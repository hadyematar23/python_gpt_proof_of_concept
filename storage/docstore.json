Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973)\nRoe v. Wade\nNo. 70-18\nArgued December 13, 1971\nReargued October 11, 1972\nDecided January 22, 1973\n410 U.S. 113\nMR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court.\nThis Texas federal appeal and its Georgia companion, Doe v. Bolton, post, p. 179, present constitutional challenges to state criminal abortion legislation. The Texas statutes under attack here are typical of those that have been in effect in many States for approximately a century. The Georgia statutes, in contrast, have a modern cast, and are a legislative product that, to an extent at least, obviously reflects the influences of recent attitudinal change, of advancing medical knowledge and techniques, and of new thinking about an old issue.\nWe forthwith acknowledge our awareness of the sensitive and emotional nature of the abortion controversy, of the vigorous opposing views, even among physicians, and of the deep and seemingly absolute convictions that the subject inspires. One's philosophy, one's experiences, one's exposure to the raw edges of human existence, one's religious training, one's attitudes toward life and family and their values, and the moral standards one establishes and seeks to observe, are all likely to influence and to color one's thinking and conclusions about abortion.\nIn addition, population growth, pollution, poverty, and racial overtones tend to complicate and not to simplify the problem.\nOur task, of course, is to resolve the issue by constitutional measurement, free of emotion and of predilection. We seek earnestly to do this, and, because we do, we\n[117]\nhave inquired into, and in this opinion place some emphasis upon, medical and medical-legal history and what that history reveals about man's attitudes toward the abortion procedure over the centuries. We bear in mind, too, Mr. Justice Holmes' admonition in his now-vindicated dissent in Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 76 (1905):\n\"[The Constitution] is made for people of fundamentally differing views, and the accident of our finding certain opinions natural and familiar or novel and even shocking ought not to conclude our judgment upon the question whether statutes embodying them conflict with the Constitution of the United States.\"\nI\nThe Texas statutes that concern us here are Arts. 1191-1194 and 1196 of the State's Penal Code. [Footnote 1] These make it a crime to \"procure an abortion,\" as therein\n[118]\ndefined, or to attempt one, except with respect to \"an abortion procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother.\" Similar statutes are in existence in a majority of the States. [Footnote 2]\n[119]\nTexas first enacted a criminal abortion statute in 1854. Texas Laws 1854, c. 49, \u00c2\u00a7 1, set forth in 3 H. Gammel, Laws of Texas 1502 (1898).

The final article in each of these compilations provided the same exception, as does the present Article 1196, for an abortion by \"medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother.\" [Footnote 3]\n[120]\nII\nJane Roe, [Footnote 4] a single woman who was residing in Dallas County, Texas, instituted this federal action in March 1970 against the District Attorney of the county. She sought a declaratory judgment that the Texas criminal abortion statutes were unconstitutional on their face, and an injunction restraining the defendant from enforcing the statutes.\nRoe alleged that she was unmarried and pregnant; that she wished to terminate her pregnancy by an abortion \"performed by a competent, licensed physician, under safe, clinical conditions\"; that she was unable to get a \"legal\" abortion in Texas because her life did not appear to be threatened by the continuation of her pregnancy; and that she could not afford to travel to another jurisdiction in order to secure a legal abortion under safe conditions. She claimed that the Texas statutes were unconstitutionally vague and that they abridged her right of personal privacy, protected by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. By an amendment to her complaint, Roe purported to sue \"on behalf of herself and all other women\" similarly situated.\nJames Hubert Hallford, a licensed physician, sought and was granted leave to intervene in Roe's action. In his complaint, he alleged that he had been arrested previously for violations of the Texas abortion statutes, and\n[121]\nthat two such prosecutions were pending against him. He described conditions of patients who came to him seeking abortions, and he claimed that for many cases he, as a physician, was unable to determine whether they fell within or outside the exception recognized by Article 1196. He alleged that, as a consequence, the statutes were vague and uncertain, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that they violated his own and his patients' rights to privacy in the doctor-patient relationship and his own right to practice medicine, rights he claimed were guaranteed by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.\nJohn and Mary Doe, [Footnote 5] a married couple, filed a companion complaint to that of Roe. They also named the District Attorney as defendant, claimed like constitutional deprivations, and sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The Does alleged that they were a childless couple; that Mrs. Doe was suffering from a \"neural-chemical\" disorder; that her physician had \"advised her to avoid pregnancy until such time as her condition has materially improved\" (although a pregnancy at the present time would not present \"a serious risk\" to her life); that, pursuant to medical advice, she had discontinued use of birth control pills; and that, if she should become pregnant, she would want to terminate the pregnancy by an abortion performed by a competent, licensed physician under safe, clinical conditions. By an amendment to their complaint, the Does purported to sue \"on behalf of themselves and all couples similarly situated.\"\nThe two actions were consolidated and heard together by a duly convened three-judge district court. The suits thus presented the situations of the pregnant single woman, the childless couple, with the wife not pregnant,\n[122]\nand the licensed practicing physician, all joining in the attack on the Texas criminal abortion statutes.

Upon the filing of affidavits, motions were made for dismissal and for summary judgment. The court held that Roe and members of her class, and Dr. Hallford, had standing to sue and presented justiciable controversies, but that the Does had failed to allege facts sufficient to state a present controversy, and did not have standing. It concluded that, with respect to the requests for a declaratory judgment, abstention was not warranted. On the merits, the District Court held that the\n\"fundamental right of single women and married persons to choose whether to have children is protected by the Ninth Amendment, through the Fourteenth Amendment,\"\nand that the Texas criminal abortion statutes were void on their face because they were both unconstitutionally vague and constituted an overbroad infringement of the plaintiffs' Ninth Amendment rights. The court then held that abstention was warranted with respect to the requests for an injunction. It therefore dismissed the Does' complaint, declared the abortion statutes void, and dismissed the application for injunctive relief. 314 F. Supp. 1217, 1225 (ND Tex.1970).\nThe plaintiffs Roe and Doe and the intervenor Hallford, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7 1253, have appealed to this Court from that part of the District Court's judgment denying the injunction. The defendant District Attorney has purported to cross-appeal, pursuant to the same statute, from the court's grant of declaratory relief to Roe and Hallford. Both sides also have taken protective appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That court ordered the appeals held in abeyance pending decision here. We postponed decision on jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits. 402 U.S. 941 (1971)\n[123]\nIt might have been preferable if the defendant, pursuant to our Rule 20, had presented to us a petition for certiorari before judgment in the Court of Appeals with respect to the granting of the plaintiffs' prayer for declaratory relief. Our decisions in Mitchell v. Donovan, 398 U. S. 427 (1970), and Gunn v. University Committee, 399 U. S. 383 (1970), are to the effect that \u00c2\u00a7 1253 does not authorize an appeal to this Court from the grant or denial of declaratory relief alone. We conclude, nevertheless, that those decisions do not foreclose our review of both the injunctive and the declaratory aspects of a case of this kind when it is properly here, as this one is, on appeal under 1253 from specific denial of injunctive relief, and the arguments as to both aspects are necessarily identical. See Carter v. Jury Comm'n, 396 U. S. 320 (1970); Florida Lime Growers v. Jacobsen, 362 U. S. 73, 80-81 (1960). It would be destructive of time and energy for all concerned were we to rule otherwise.

Cohen, 392 U. S. 83, 101 (1968), and Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727, 732 (1972)? And what effect did the pendency of criminal abortion charges against Dr. Hallford in state court have upon the propriety of the federal court's granting relief to him as a plaintiff-intervenor?\n[124]\nA. Jane Roe. Despite the use of the pseudonym, no suggestion is made that Roe is a fictitious person. For purposes of her case, we accept as true, and as established, her existence; her pregnant state, as of the inception of her suit in March 1970 and as late as May 21 of that year when she filed an alias affidavit with the District Court; and her inability to obtain a legal abortion in Texas.\nViewing Roe's case as of the time of its filing and thereafter until as late a May, there can be little dispute that it then presented a case or controversy and that, wholly apart from the class aspects, she, as a pregnant single woman thwarted by the Texas criminal abortion laws, had standing to challenge those statutes. Abele v. Markle, 452 F.2d 1121, 1125 (CA2 1971); Crossen v. Breckenridge, 446 F.2d 833, 838-839 (CA6 1971); Poe v. Menghini, 339 F. Supp. 986, 990-991 (Kan.1972). See Truax v. Raich, 239 U. S. 33 (1915). Indeed, we do not read the appellee's brief as really asserting anything to the contrary. The \"logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim sought to be adjudicated,\" Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. at 102, and the necessary degree of contentiousness, Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U. S. 103 (1969), are both present.\nThe appellee notes, however, that the record does not disclose that Roe was pregnant at the time of the District Court hearing on May 22, 1970, [Footnote 6] or on the following June 17 when the court's opinion and judgment were filed. And he suggests that Roe's case must now be moot because she and all other members of her class are no longer subject to any 1970 pregnancy.\n[125]\nThe usual rule in federal cases is that an actual controversy must exist at stages of appellate or certiorari review, and not simply at the date the action is initiated. United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36 (1950); Golden v. Zwickler, supra; SEC v. Medical Committee for Human Rights, 404 U. S. 403 (1972).\nBut when, as here, pregnancy is a significant fact in the litigation, the normal 266-day human gestation period is so short that the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is complete. If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied. Our law should not be that rigid.

If that termination makes a case moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied. Our law should not be that rigid. Pregnancy often comes more than once to the same woman, and in the general population, if man is to survive, it will always be with us. Pregnancy provides a classic justification for a conclusion of nonmootness. It truly could be \"capable of repetition, yet evading review.\" Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U. S. 498, 515 (1911). See Moore v. Ogilvie, 394 U. S. 814, 816 (1969); Carroll v. Princess Anne, 393 U. S. 175, 178-179 (1968); United States v. W. T. Grant Co., 345 U. S. 629, 632-633 (1953).\nWe, therefore, agree with the District Court that Jane Roe had standing to undertake this litigation, that she presented a justiciable controversy, and that the termination of her 1970 pregnancy has not rendered her case moot.\nB. Dr. Hallford. The doctor's position is different. He entered Roe's litigation as a plaintiff-intervenor, alleging in his complaint that he:\n\"[I]n the past has been arrested for violating the Texas Abortion Laws and at the present time stands charged by indictment with violating said laws in the Criminal District Court of Dallas County, Texas to-wit: (1) The State of Texas vs.\n[126]\nJames H. Hallford, No. C-69-5307-IH, and (2) The State of Texas vs. James H. Hallford, No. C-692524-H. In both cases, the defendant is charged with abortion.\u00c2 .\u00c2 .\u00c2 .\"\nIn his application for leave to intervene, the doctor made like representations as to the abortion charges pending in the state court. These representations were also repeated in the affidavit he executed and filed in support of his motion for summary judgment.\nDr. Hallford is, therefore, in the position of seeking, in a federal court, declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to the same statutes under which he stands charged in criminal prosecutions simultaneously pending in state court. Although he stated that he has been arrested in the past for violating the State's abortion laws, he makes no allegation of any substantial and immediate threat to any federally protected right that cannot be asserted in his defense against the state prosecutions. Neither is there any allegation of harassment or bad faith prosecution. In order to escape the rule articulated in the cases cited in the next paragraph of this opinion that, absent harassment and bad faith, a defendant in a pending state criminal case cannot affirmatively challenge in federal court the statutes under which the State is prosecuting him, Dr. Hallford seeks to distinguish his status as a present state defendant from his status as a \"potential future defendant,\" and to assert only the latter for standing purposes here.\nWe see no merit in that distinction. Our decision in Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U. S. 66 (1971), compels the conclusion that the District Court erred when it granted declaratory relief to Dr. Hallford instead of refraining from so doing. The court, of course, was correct in refusing to grant injunctive relief to the doctor. The reasons supportive of that action, however, are those expressed in Samuels v. Mackell, supra, and in", "doc_id": "4526d570-b98c-4252-adb3-16a6cf71df7f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e44b49d7c807cb6cd6872727ccac960c5fd0c1b97009f69b2aed7145e1f16321", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1h88X1fim6qGuofDqwn0Kf3_zekWIpFO5JjFaMQxz2QQ"}, "node_info": {"start": 13988, "end": 17707}, "relationships": {"1": "634078de-0cfa-48df-858e-10a777c2eb3e", "2": "c7241e2a-8ba6-487c-8cde-74664eb43a5f", "3": "c9f602b9-0ad6-413d-8276-8af73180d79f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9f602b9-0ad6-413d-8276-8af73180d79f": {"__data__": {"text": "harassment and bad faith, a defendant in a pending state criminal case cannot affirmatively challenge in federal court the statutes under which the State is prosecuting him, Dr. Hallford seeks to distinguish his status as a present state defendant from his status as a \"potential future defendant,\" and to assert only the latter for standing purposes here.\nWe see no merit in that distinction. Our decision in Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U. S. 66 (1971), compels the conclusion that the District Court erred when it granted declaratory relief to Dr. Hallford instead of refraining from so doing. The court, of course, was correct in refusing to grant injunctive relief to the doctor. The reasons supportive of that action, however, are those expressed in Samuels v. Mackell, supra, and in Younger v.\n[127]\nHarris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971); Boyle v. Landry, 401 U. S. 77 (1971); Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U. S. 82 (1971); and Byrne v. Karaleis, 401 U. S. 216 (1971). See also Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479 (1965). We note, in passing, that Younger and its companion cases were decided after the three-judge District Court decision in this case.\nDr. Hallford's complaint in intervention, therefore, is to be dismissed. [Footnote 7] He is remitted to his defenses in the state criminal proceedings against him. We reverse the judgment of the District Court insofar as it granted Dr. Hallford relief and failed to dismiss his complaint in intervention.\nC. The Does. In view of our ruling as to Roe's standing in her case, the issue of the Does' standing in their case has little significance. The claims they assert are essentially the same as those of Roe, and they attack the same statutes. Nevertheless, we briefly note the Does' posture.\nTheir pleadings present them as a childless married couple, the woman not being pregnant, who have no desire to have children at this time because of their having received medical advice that Mrs. Doe should avoid pregnancy, and for \"other highly personal reasons.\" But they \"fear .\u00c2 .\u00c2 . they may face the prospect of becoming\n[128]\nparents.\" And if pregnancy ensues, they \"would want to terminate\" it by an abortion. They assert an inability to obtain an abortion legally in Texas and, consequently, the prospect of obtaining an illegal abortion there or of going outside Texas to some place where the procedure could be obtained legally and competently.\nWe thus have as plaintiffs a married couple who have, as their asserted immediate and present injury, only an alleged \"detrimental effect upon [their] marital happiness\" because they are forced to \"the choice of refraining from normal sexual relations or of endangering Mary Doe's health through a possible pregnancy.\" Their claim is that, sometime in the future, Mrs. Doe might become pregnant because of possible failure of contraceptive measures, and, at that time in the future, she might want an abortion that might then be illegal under the Texas statutes.\nThis very phrasing of the Does' position reveals its speculative character. Their alleged injury rests on possible future contraceptive failure, possible future pregnancy, possible future unpreparedness for parenthood, and possible future impairment of health. Any one or more of these several possibilities may not take place, and all may not combine. In the Does' estimation, these possibilities might have some real or imagined impact upon their marital happiness. But we are not prepared to say that the bare allegation of so indirect an injury is sufficient to present an actual case or controversy. Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. at 41-42; Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S. at 109-110; Abele v. Markle, 452 F.2d at 1124-1125; Crossen v.

The Does' claim falls far short of those resolved otherwise in the cases that the Does urge upon us, namely, Investment Co. Institute v. Camp, 401 U. S. 617 (1971); Data Processing Service v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150 (1970);\n[129]\nand Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U. S. 97 (1968). See also Truax v. Raich, 239 U. S. 33 (1915).\nThe Does therefore are not appropriate plaintiffs in this litigation. Their complaint was properly dismissed by the District Court, and we affirm that dismissal.\nV\nThe principal thrust of appellant's attack on the Texas statutes is that they improperly invade a right, said to be possessed by the pregnant woman, to choose to terminate her pregnancy. Appellant would discover this right in the concept of personal \"liberty\" embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause; or in personal, marital, familial, and sexual privacy said to be protected by the Bill of Rights or its penumbras, see Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972); id. at 460 (WHITE, J., concurring in result); or among those rights reserved to the people by the Ninth Amendment, Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. at 486 (Goldberg, J., concurring). Before addressing this claim, we feel it desirable briefly to survey, in several aspects, the history of abortion, for such insight as that history may afford us, and then to examine the state purposes and interests behind the criminal abortion laws.\nVI\nIt perhaps is not generally appreciated that the restrictive criminal abortion laws in effect in a majority of States today are of relatively recent vintage. Those laws, generally proscribing abortion or its attempt at any time during pregnancy except when necessary to preserve the pregnant woman's life, are not of ancient or even of common law origin. Instead, they derive from statutory changes effected, for the most part, in the latter half of the 19th century.\n[130]\n1. Ancient attitudes. These are not capable of precise determination. We are told that, at the time of the Persian Empire, abortifacients were known, and that criminal abortions were severely punished. [Footnote 8] We are also told, however, that abortion was practiced in Greek times as well as in the Roman Era, [Footnote 9] and that \"it was resorted to without scruple.\" [Footnote 10] The Ephesian, Soranos, often described as the greatest of the ancient gynecologists, appears to have been generally opposed to Rome's prevailing free-abortion practices. He found it necessary to think first of the life of the mother, and he resorted to abortion when, upon this standard, he felt the procedure advisable.

The Hippocratic Oath. What then of the famous Oath that has stood so long as the ethical guide of the medical profession and that bears the name of the great Greek (460(?)-377(?) B. C.), who has been described\n[131]\nas the Father of Medicine, the \"wisest and the greatest practitioner of his art,\" and the \"most important and most complete medical personality of antiquity,\" who dominated the medical schools of his time, and who typified the sum of the medical knowledge of the past? [Footnote 13] The Oath varies somewhat according to the particular translation, but in any translation the content is clear:\n\"I will give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; and in like manner, I will not give to a woman a pessary to produce abortion, [Footnote 14]\"\nor\n\"I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody if asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly, I will not give to a woman an abortive remedy. [Footnote 15]\"\nAlthough the Oath is not mentioned in any of the principal briefs in this case or in Doe v. Bolton, post, p. 179, it represents the apex of the development of strict ethical concepts in medicine, and its influence endures to this day. Why did not the authority of Hippocrates dissuade abortion practice in his time and that of Rome? The late Dr. Edelstein provides us with a theory: [Footnote 16] The Oath was not uncontested even in Hippocrates' day; only the Pythagorean school of philosophers frowned upon the related act of suicide. Most Greek thinkers, on the other hand, commended abortion, at least prior to viability. See Plato, Republic, V, 461; Aristotle, Politics, VII, 1335b 25. For the Pythagoreans, however, it was a matter of dogma. For them, the embryo was animate from the moment of conception, and abortion meant destruction of a living being. The abortion clause of the Oath, therefore, \"echoes Pythagorean doctrines,\"\n[132]\nand \"[i]n no other stratum of Greek opinion were such views held or proposed in the same spirit of uncompromising austerity.\" [Footnote 17]\nDr. Edelstein then concludes that the Oath originated in a group representing only a small segment of Greek opinion, and that it certainly was not accepted by all ancient physicians. He points out that medical writings down to Galen (A.D. 130-200) \"give evidence of the violation of almost every one of its injunctions.\" [Footnote 18] But with the end of antiquity, a decided change took place. Resistance against suicide and against abortion became common. The Oath came to be popular. The emerging teachings of Christianity were in agreement with the Pythagorean ethic. The Oath \"became the nucleus of all medical ethics,\" and \"was applauded as the embodiment of truth.\" Thus, suggests Dr. Edelstein, it is \"a Pythagorean manifesto, and not the expression of an absolute standard of medical conduct.\" [Footnote 19]\nThis, it", "doc_id": "9f5c9331-57cd-4d30-9170-64c50fb0257a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2f4c2bd819855406e7c2d7f77d133bb3c8dd23170b56d39701166bba4fc0894f", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1h88X1fim6qGuofDqwn0Kf3_zekWIpFO5JjFaMQxz2QQ"}, "node_info": {"start": 25031, "end": 28711}, "relationships": {"1": "634078de-0cfa-48df-858e-10a777c2eb3e", "2": "a882ad5b-2f8f-4981-841d-a227ff5058d9", "3": "46745ea8-6fbb-4992-981a-c5241a05e7f9"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "46745ea8-6fbb-4992-981a-c5241a05e7f9": {"__data__": {"text": "only a small segment of Greek opinion, and that it certainly was not accepted by all ancient physicians.

It enables us to understand, in historical context, a long-accepted and revered statement of medical ethics.\n3. The common law. It is undisputed that, at common law, abortion performed before \"quickening\" -- the first recognizable movement of the fetus in utero, appearing usually from the 16th to the 18th week of pregnancy [Footnote 20] -- was not an indictable offense. [Footnote 21] The absence\n[133]\nof a common law crime for pre-quickening abortion appears to have developed from a confluence of earlier philosophical, theological, and civil and canon law concepts of when life begins. These disciplines variously approached the question in terms of the point at which the embryo or fetus became \"formed\" or recognizably human, or in terms of when a \"person\" came into being, that is, infused with a \"soul\" or \"animated.\" A loose consensus evolved in early English law that these events occurred at some point between conception and live birth. [Footnote 22] This was \"mediate animation.\" Although\n[134]\nChristian theology and the canon law came to fix the point of animation at 40 days for a male and 80 days for a female, a view that persisted until the 19th century, there was otherwise little agreement about the precise time of formation or animation. There was agreement, however, that, prior to this point, the fetus was to be regarded as part of the mother, and its destruction, therefore, was not homicide. Due to continued uncertainty about the precise time when animation occurred, to the lack of any empirical basis for the 40-80-day view, and perhaps to Aquinas' definition of movement as one of the two first principles of life, Bracton focused upon quickening as the critical point. The significance of quickening was echoed by later common law scholars, and found its way into the received common law in this country.\nWhether abortion of a quick fetus was a felony at common law, or even a lesser crime, is still disputed. Bracton, writing early in the 13th century, thought it homicide. [Footnote 23] But the later and predominant view, following the great common law scholars, has been that it was, at most, a lesser offense. In a frequently cited\n[135]\npassage, Coke took the position that abortion of a woman \"quick with childe\" is \"a great misprision, and no murder.\" [Footnote 24] Blackstone followed, saying that, while abortion after quickening had once been considered manslaughter (though not murder), \"modern law\" took a less severe view. [Footnote 25] A recent review of the common law precedents argues, however, that those precedents contradict Coke, and that even post-quickening abortion was never established as a common law crime. [Footnote 26] This is of some importance, because, while most American courts ruled, in holding or dictum, that abortion of an unquickened fetus was not criminal under their received common law, [Footnote 27] others followed Coke in stating that abortion\n[136]\nof a quick fetus was a", "doc_id": "46745ea8-6fbb-4992-981a-c5241a05e7f9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4fb4d8f4eb11c82e6143826d6465583b3af4f2cdb27e8895f33a162ab71801d2", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1h88X1fim6qGuofDqwn0Kf3_zekWIpFO5JjFaMQxz2QQ"}, "node_info": {"start": 28748, "end": 32553}, "relationships": {"1": "634078de-0cfa-48df-858e-10a777c2eb3e", "2": "9f5c9331-57cd-4d30-9170-64c50fb0257a", "3": "12bab076-b2f9-4284-a791-b510e666f4da"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "12bab076-b2f9-4284-a791-b510e666f4da": {"__data__": {"text": "Coke took the position that abortion of a woman \"quick with childe\" is \"a great misprision, and no murder.\" [Footnote 24] Blackstone followed, saying that, while abortion after quickening had once been considered manslaughter (though not murder), \"modern law\" took a less severe view.

The English statutory law. England's first criminal abortion statute, Lord Ellenborough's Act, 43 Geo. 3, c. 58, came in 1803. It made abortion of a quick fetus, \u00c2\u00a7 1, a capital crime, but, in \u00c2\u00a7 2, it provided lesser penalties for the felony of abortion before quickening, and thus preserved the \"quickening\" distinction. This contrast was continued in the general revision of 1828, 9 Geo. 4, c. 31, \u00c2\u00a7 13. It disappeared, however, together with the death penalty, in 1837, 7 Will. 4 & 1 Vict., c. 85. \u00c2\u00a7 6, and did not reappear in the Offenses Against the Person Act of 1861, 24 & 25 Vict., c. 100, \u00c2\u00a7 59, that formed the core of English anti-abortion law until the liberalizing reforms of 1967. In 1929, the Infant Life (Preservation) Act, 19 & 20 Geo. 5, c. 34, came into being. Its emphasis was upon the destruction of \"the life of a child capable of being born alive.\" It made a willful act performed with the necessary intent a felony. It contained a proviso that one was not to be\n[137]\nfound guilty of the offense\n\"unless it is proved that the act which caused the death of the child was not done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother.\"\nA seemingly notable development in the English law was the case of Rex v. Bourne, [1939] 1 K.B. 687. This case apparently answered in the affirmative the question whether an abortion necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman was excepted from the criminal penalties of the 1861 Act. In his instructions to the jury, Judge Macnaghten referred to the 1929 Act, and observed that that Act related to \"the case where a child is killed by a willful act at the time when it is being delivered in the ordinary course of nature.\" Id. at 691. He concluded that the 1861 Act's use of the word \"unlawfully,\" imported the same meaning expressed by the specific proviso in the 1929 Act, even though there was no mention of preserving the mother's life in the 1861 Act. He then construed the phrase \"preserving the life of the mother\" broadly, that is, \"in a reasonable sense,\" to include a serious and permanent threat to the mother's health, and instructed the jury to acquit Dr. Bourne if it found he had acted in a good faith belief that the abortion was necessary for this purpose. Id. at 693-694. The jury did acquit.\nRecently, Parliament enacted a new abortion law. This is the Abortion Act of 1967, 15 & 16 Eliz. 2, c. 87.

The American law. In this country, the law in effect in all but a few States until mid-19th century was the preexisting English common law. Connecticut, the first State to enact abortion legislation, adopted in 1821 that part of Lord Ellenborough's Act that related to a woman \"quick with child.\" [Footnote 29] The death penalty was not imposed. Abortion before quickening was made a crime in that State only in 1860. [Footnote 30] In 1828, New York enacted legislation [Footnote 31] that, in two respects, was to serve as a model for early anti-abortion statutes. First, while barring destruction of an unquickened fetus as well as a quick fetus, it made the former only a misdemeanor, but the latter second-degree manslaughter. Second, it incorporated a concept of therapeutic abortion by providing that an abortion was excused if it\n\"shall have been necessary to preserve the life of such mother, or shall have been advised by two physicians to be necessary for such purpose.\"\nBy 1840, when Texas had received the common law, [Footnote 32] only eight American States\n[139]\nhad statutes dealing with abortion. [Footnote 33] It was not until after the War Between the States that legislation began generally to replace the common law. Most of these initial statutes dealt severely with abortion after quickening, but were lenient with it before quickening. Most punished attempts equally with completed abortions. While many statutes included the exception for an abortion thought by one or more physicians to be necessary to save the mother's life, that provision soon disappeared, and the typical law required that the procedure actually be necessary for that purpose. Gradually, in the middle and late 19th century, the quickening distinction disappeared from the statutory law of most States and the degree of the offense and the penalties were increased. By the end of the 1950's, a large majority of the jurisdictions banned abortion, however and whenever performed, unless done to save or preserve the life of the mother. [Footnote 34] The exceptions, Alabama and the District of Columbia, permitted abortion to preserve the mother's health. [Footnote 35] Three States permitted abortions that were not \"unlawfully\" performed or that were not \"without lawful justification,\" leaving interpretation of those standards to the courts.

[Footnote 36] In\n[140]\nthe past several years, however, a trend toward liberalization of abortion statutes has resulted in adoption, by about one-third of the States, of less stringent laws, most of them patterned after the ALI Model Penal Code, \u00c2\u00a7 230.3, [Footnote 37] set forth as Appendix B to the opinion in Doe v. Bolton, post, p. 205.\nIt is thus apparent that, at common law, at the time of the adoption of our Constitution, and throughout the major portion of the 19th century, abortion was viewed with less disfavor than under most American statutes currently in effect. Phrasing it another way, a woman enjoyed a substantially broader right to terminate a pregnancy than she does in most States today. At least with respect to the early stage of pregnancy, and very possibly without such a limitation, the opportunity\n[141]\nto make this choice was present in this country well into the 19th century. Even later, the law continued for some time to treat less punitively an abortion procured in early pregnancy.\n6. The position of the American Medical Association. The anti-abortion mood prevalent in this country in the late 19th century was shared by the medical profession. Indeed, the attitude of the profession may have played a significant role in the enactment of stringent criminal abortion legislation during that period.\nAn AMA Committee on Criminal Abortion was appointed in May, 1857. It presented its report, 12 Trans. of the Am.Med.Assn. 778 (1859), to the Twelfth Annual Meeting. That report observed that the Committee had been appointed to investigate criminal abortion \"with a view to its general suppression.\" It deplored abortion and its frequency and it listed three causes of \"this general demoralization\":\n\"The first of these causes is a widespread popular ignorance of the true character of the crime -- a belief, even among mothers themselves, that the foetus is not alive till after the period of quickening.\"\n\"The second of the agents alluded to is the fact that the profession themselves are frequently supposed careless of foetal life.\u00c2 .\u00c2 .\u00c2 .\"\n\"The third reason of the frightful extent of this crime is found in the grave defects of our laws, both common and statute, as regards the independent and actual existence of the child before birth, as a living being. These errors, which are sufficient in most instances to prevent conviction, are based, and only based, upon mistaken and exploded medical dogmas. With strange inconsistency, the law fully acknowledges the foetus in utero and its inherent rights, for civil purposes; while personally and as criminally affected, it fails to recognize it,\n[142]\nand to its life as yet denies all protection.\"\nId. at 776. The Committee then offered, and the Association adopted, resolutions protesting \"against such unwarrantable destruction of human life,\" calling upon state legislatures to revise their abortion laws, and requesting the cooperation of state medical societies \"in pressing the subject.\" Id. at 28, 78.\nIn 1871, a long and vivid report was submitted by the Committee on Criminal Abortion. It ended with the observation,\n\"We had to deal with human life. In a matter of less importance, we could entertain no compromise.

It proffered resolutions, adopted by the Association, id. at 38-39, recommending, among other things, that it\n\"be unlawful and unprofessional for any physician to induce abortion or premature labor without the concurrent opinion of at least one respectable consulting physician, and then always with a view to the safety of the child -- if that be possible,\"\nand calling\n\"the attention of the clergy of all denominations to the perverted views of morality entertained by a large class of females -- aye, and men also, on this important question.\"\nExcept for periodic condemnation of the criminal abortionist, no further formal AMA action took place until 1967. In that year, the Committee on Human Reproduction urged the adoption of a stated policy of opposition to induced abortion except when there is \"documented medical evidence\" of a threat to the health or life of the mother, or that the child \"may be born with incapacitating physical deformity or mental deficiency,\" or that a pregnancy \"resulting from legally established statutory or forcible rape or incest may constitute a threat to the mental or physical health of the\n[143]\npatient,\" two other physicians \"chosen because of their recognized professional competence have examined the patient and have concurred in writing,\" and the procedure \"is performed in a hospital accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals.\" The providing of medical information by physicians to state legislatures in their consideration of legislation regarding therapeutic abortion was \"to be considered consistent with the principles of ethics of the American Medical Association.\" This recommendation was adopted by the House of Delegates. Proceedings of the AMA House of Delegates 40-51 (June 1967).\nIn 1970, after the introduction of a variety of proposed resolutions and of a report from its Board of Trustees, a reference committee noted \"polarization of the medical profession on this controversial issue\"; division among those who had testified; a difference of opinion among AMA councils and.committees; \"the remarkable shift in testimony\" in six months, felt to be influenced \"by the rapid changes in state laws and by the judicial decisions which tend to make abortion more freely available; \" and a feeling \"that this trend will continue.\" On June 25, 1970, the House of Delegates adopted preambles and most of the resolutions proposed by the reference committee. The preambles emphasized \"the best interests of the patient,\" \"sound clinical judgment,\" and \"informed patient consent,\" in contrast to \"mere acquiescence to the patient's demand.\" The resolutions asserted that abortion is a medical procedure that should be performed by a licensed physician in an accredited hospital only after consultation with two other physicians and in conformity with state law, and that no party to the procedure should be required to violate personally held moral principles.

The position of the American Public Health Association. In October, 1970, the Executive Board of the APHA adopted Standards for Abortion Services. These were five in number:\n\"a. Rapid and simple abortion referral must be readily available through state and local public\n[145]\nhealth departments, medical societies, or other nonprofit organizations.\"\n\"b. An important function of counseling should be to simplify and expedite the provision of abortion services; it should not delay the obtaining of these services.\"\n\"c. Psychiatric consultation should not be mandatory. As in the case of other specialized medical services, psychiatric consultation should be sought for definite indications, and not on a routine basis.\"\n\"d. A wide range of individuals from appropriately trained, sympathetic volunteers to highly skilled physicians may qualify as abortion counselors.\"\n\"e. Contraception and/or sterilization should be discussed with each abortion patient.\"\n\"Recommended Standards for Abortion Services, 61 Am.J.Pub.Health 396 (1971). Among factors pertinent to life and health risks associated with abortion were three that 'are recognized as important': \"\n\"a. the skill of the physician,\"\n\"b. the environment in which the abortion is performed, and above all\"\n\"c. the duration of pregnancy, as determined by uterine size and confirmed by menstrual history.\"\nId. at 397.\nIt was said that \"a well equipped hospital\" offers more protection\n\"to cope with unforeseen difficulties than an office or clinic without such resources.\u00c2 .\u00c2 .\u00c2 . The factor of gestational age is of overriding importance.\"\nThus, it was recommended that abortions in the second trimester and early abortions in the presence of existing medical complications be performed in hospitals as inpatient procedures. For pregnancies in the first trimester,\n[146]\nabortion in the hospital with or without overnight stay \"is probably the safest practice.\" An abortion in an extramural facility, however, is an acceptable alternative \"provided arrangements exist in advance to admit patients promptly if unforeseen complications develop.\" Standards for an abortion facility were listed. It was said that, at present, abortions should be performed by physicians or osteopaths who are licensed to practice and who have \"adequate training.\" Id. at 398.\n8.

[Footnote 41]\nVII\nThree reasons have been advanced to explain historically the enactment of criminal abortion laws in the 19th century and to justify their continued existence.\n[148]\nIt has been argued occasionally that these laws were the product of a Victorian social concern to discourage illicit sexual conduct. Texas, however, does not advance this justification in the present case, and it appears that no court or commentator has taken the argument seriously. [Footnote 42] The appellants and amici contend, moreover, that this is not a proper state purpose, at all and suggest that, if it were, the Texas statutes are overbroad in protecting it, since the law fails to distinguish between married and unwed mothers.\nA second reason is concerned with abortion as a medical procedure. When most criminal abortion laws were first enacted, the procedure was a hazardous one for the woman. [Footnote 43] This was particularly true prior to the\n[149]\ndevelopment of antisepsis. Antiseptic techniques, of course, were based on discoveries by Lister, Pasteur, and others first announced in 1867, but were not generally accepted and employed until about the turn of the century. Abortion mortality was high. Even after 1900, and perhaps until as late as the development of antibiotics in the 1940's, standard modern techniques such as dilation and curettage were not nearly so safe as they are today. Thus, it has been argued that a State's real concern in enacting a criminal abortion law was to protect the pregnant woman, that is, to restrain her from submitting to a procedure that placed her life in serious jeopardy.\nModern medical techniques have altered this situation. Appellants and various amici refer to medical data indicating that abortion in early pregnancy, that is, prior to the end of the first trimester, although not without its risk, is now relatively safe. Mortality rates for women undergoing early abortions, where the procedure is legal, appear to be as low as or lower than the rates for normal childbirth. [Footnote 44] Consequently, any interest of the State in protecting the woman from an inherently hazardous procedure, except when it would be equally dangerous for her to forgo it, has largely disappeared. Of course, important state interests in the areas of health and medical standards do remain.\n[150]\nThe State has a legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion, like any other medical procedure, is performed under circumstances that insure maximum safety for the patient. This interest obviously extends at least to the performing physician and his staff, to the facilities involved, to the availability of after-care, and to adequate provision for any complication or emergency that might arise. The prevalence of high mortality rates at illegal \"abortion mills\" strengthens, rather than weakens, the State's interest in regulating the conditions under which abortions are performed. Moreover, the risk to the woman increases as her pregnancy continues. Thus, the State retains a definite interest in protecting the woman's own health and safety when an abortion is proposed at a late stage of pregnancy.\nThe third reason is the State's interest -- some phrase it in terms of duty -- in protecting prenatal life. Some of the argument for this justification rests on the theory that a new human life is present from the moment of conception. [Footnote 45] The State's interest and general obligation to protect life then extends, it is argued, to prenatal life. Only when the life of the pregnant mother herself is at stake, balanced against the life she carries within her, should the interest of the embryo or fetus not prevail. Logically, of course, a legitimate state interest in this area need not stand or fall on acceptance of the belief that life", "doc_id": "8a3e7260-377c-4802-8b1f-58275134e32a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1db4ce90b37bb4daeaaa6ce507b1ce5a71f1e3b73cb7b0ea19509f56670024df", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1h88X1fim6qGuofDqwn0Kf3_zekWIpFO5JjFaMQxz2QQ"}, "node_info": {"start": 52390, "end": 56461}, "relationships": {"1": "634078de-0cfa-48df-858e-10a777c2eb3e", "2": "2769eb0f-2b2e-43fd-9fd6-b516d90e921a", "3": "4ef6cb35-c57f-4031-9af2-b141b500110e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ef6cb35-c57f-4031-9af2-b141b500110e": {"__data__": {"text": "woman increases as her pregnancy continues.

Logically, of course, a legitimate state interest in this area need not stand or fall on acceptance of the belief that life begins at conception or at some other point prior to live birth. In assessing the State's interest, recognition may be given to the less rigid claim that as long as at least potential life is involved, the State may assert interests beyond the protection of the pregnant woman alone.\n[151]\nParties challenging state abortion laws have sharply disputed in some courts the contention that a purpose of these laws, when enacted, was to protect prenatal life. [Footnote 46] Pointing to the absence of legislative history to support the contention, they claim that most state laws were designed solely to protect the woman. Because medical advances have lessened this concern, at least with respect to abortion in early pregnancy, they argue that with respect to such abortions the laws can no longer be justified by any state interest. There is some scholarly support for this view of original purpose. [Footnote 47] The few state courts called upon to interpret their laws in the late 19th and early 20th centuries did focus on the State's interest in protecting the woman's health, rather than in preserving the embryo and fetus. [Footnote 48] Proponents of this view point out that in many States, including Texas, [Footnote 49] by statute or judicial interpretation, the pregnant woman herself could not be prosecuted for self-abortion or for cooperating in an abortion performed upon her by another. [Footnote 50] They claim that adoption of the \"quickening\" distinction through received common\n[152]\nlaw and state statutes tacitly recognizes the greater health hazards inherent in late abortion and impliedly repudiates the theory that life begins at conception.\nIt is with these interests, and the eight to be attached to them, that this case is concerned.\nVIII\nThe Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy. In a line of decisions, however, going back perhaps as far as Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U. S. 250, 251 (1891), the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the Constitution. In varying contexts, the Court or individual Justices have, indeed, found at least the roots of that right in the First Amendment, Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557, 564 (1969); in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 8-9 (1968), Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 350 (1967), Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616 (1886), see Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); in the penumbras of the Bill of Rights, Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. at 484-485; in the Ninth Amendment, id. at 486 (Goldberg, J., concurring); or in the concept of liberty guaranteed by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, see Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399 (1923).

Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399 (1923). These decisions make it clear that only personal rights that can be deemed \"fundamental\" or \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\" Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325 (1937), are included in this guarantee of personal privacy. They also make it clear that the right has some extension to activities relating to marriage, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 12 (1967); procreation, Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U. S. 535, 541-542 (1942); contraception, Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. at 453-454; id. at 460, 463-465\n[153]\n(WHITE, J., concurring in result); family relationships, Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 166 (1944); and childrearing and education, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 535 (1925), Meyer v. Nebraska, supra.\nThis right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The detriment that the State would impose upon the pregnant woman by denying this choice altogether is apparent. Specific and direct harm medically diagnosable even in early pregnancy may be involved. Maternity, or additional offspring, may force upon the woman a distressful life and future. Psychological harm may be imminent. Mental and physical health may be taxed by child care. There is also the distress, for all concerned, associated with the unwanted child, and there is the problem of bringing a child into a family already unable, psychologically and otherwise, to care for it. In other cases, as in this one, the additional difficulties and continuing stigma of unwed motherhood may be involved. All these are factors the woman and her responsible physician necessarily will consider in consultation.\nOn the basis of elements such as these, appellant and some amici argue that the woman's right is absolute and that she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy at whatever time, in whatever way, and for whatever reason she alone chooses. With this we do not agree. Appellant's arguments that Texas either has no valid interest at all in regulating the abortion decision, or no interest strong enough to support any limitation upon the woman's sole determination, are unpersuasive. The\n[154]\nCourt's decisions recognizing a right of privacy also acknowledge that some state regulation in areas protected by that right is appropriate. As noted above, a State may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, in maintaining medical standards, and in protecting potential life. At some point in pregnancy, these respective interests become sufficiently compelling to sustain regulation of the factors that govern the abortion decision. The privacy right involved, therefore, cannot be said to be absolute. In fact, it is not clear to us that the claim asserted by some amici that one has an unlimited right to do with one's body as one pleases bears a close relationship to the right of privacy previously articulated in the Court's decisions. The Court has refused to recognize an unlimited right of this kind in the past.

A majority, in addition to the District Court in the present case, have held state laws unconstitutional, at least in part, because of vagueness or because of overbreadth and abridgment of rights.

Baird, 405 U.S. at 460, 463-464 (WHITE, J., concurring in result).\nIn the recent abortion cases cited above, courts have recognized these principles. Those striking down state laws have generally scrutinized the State's interests in protecting health and potential life, and have concluded that neither interest justified broad limitations on the reasons for which a physician and his pregnant patient might decide that she should have an abortion in the early stages of pregnancy. Courts sustaining state laws have held that the State's determinations to protect health or prenatal life are dominant and constitutionally justifiable.\nIX\nThe District Court held that the appellee failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the Texas statute's infringement upon Roe's rights was necessary to support a compelling state interest, and that, although the appellee presented \"several compelling justifications for state presence in the area of abortions,\" the statutes outstripped these justifications and swept \"far beyond any areas of compelling state interest.\" 314 F. Supp. at 1222-1223. Appellant and appellee both contest that holding. Appellant, as has been indicated, claims an absolute right that bars any state imposition of criminal penalties in the area. Appellee argues that the State's determination to recognize and protect prenatal life from and after conception constitutes a compelling state interest. As noted above, we do not agree fully with either formulation.\nA. The appellee and certain amici argue that the fetus is a \"person\" within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well known facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses,\n[157]\nfor the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment. The appellant conceded as much on reargument.

See Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary 478-479, 547 (24th ed.1965). The situation therefore is inherently different from marital intimacy, or bedroom possession of obscene material, or marriage, or procreation, or education, with which Eisenstadt and Griswold, Stanley, Loving, Skinner, and Pierce and Meyer were respectively concerned. As we have intimated above, it is reasonable and appropriate for a State to decide that, at some point in time another interest, that of health of the mother or that of potential human life, becomes significantly involved. The woman's privacy is no longer sole and any right of privacy she possesses must be measured accordingly.\nTexas urges that, apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, life begins at conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that, therefore, the State has a compelling interest in protecting that life from and after conception. We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.\n[160]\nIt should be sufficient to note briefly the wide divergence of thinking on this most sensitive and difficult question. There has always been strong support for the view that life does not begin until live' birth. This was the belief of the Stoics. [Footnote 56] It appears to be the predominant, though not the unanimous, attitude of the Jewish faith. [Footnote 57] It may be taken to represent also the position of a large segment of the Protestant community, insofar as that can be ascertained; organized groups that have taken a formal position on the abortion issue have generally regarded abortion as a matter for the conscience of the individual and her family. [Footnote 58] As we have noted, the common law found greater significance in quickening. Physician and their scientific colleagues have regarded that event with less interest and have tended to focus either upon conception, upon live birth, or upon the interim point at which the fetus becomes \"viable,\" that is, potentially able to live outside the mother's womb, albeit with artificial aid. [Footnote 59] Viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks. [Footnote 60] The Aristotelian theory of \"mediate animation,\" that held sway throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance in Europe, continued to be official Roman Catholic dogma until the 19th century, despite opposition to this \"ensoulment\" theory from those in the Church who would recognize the existence of life from\n[161]\nthe moment of conception. [Footnote 61] The latter is now, of course, the official belief of the Catholic Church. As one brief amicus discloses, this is a view strongly held by many non-Catholics as well, and by many physicians. Substantial problems for precise definition of this view are posed, however, by new embryological data that purport to indicate that conception is a \"process\" over time, rather than an event, and by new medical techniques such as menstrual extraction, the \"morning-after\" pill, implantation of embryos, artificial insemination, and even artificial wombs. [Footnote 62]\nIn areas other than criminal abortion, the law has been reluctant to endorse any theory that life, as we recognize", "doc_id": "0051e7b9-bec3-4705-a756-a4c5b473b5c5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3a62c6581d0a85f939febe3ba6741d37ccea05f41b6a250bb6814f18e8220cb0", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1h88X1fim6qGuofDqwn0Kf3_zekWIpFO5JjFaMQxz2QQ"}, "node_info": {"start": 74426, "end": 78449}, "relationships": {"1": "634078de-0cfa-48df-858e-10a777c2eb3e", "2": "d3b3d7c2-93ec-4dd1-9d42-bd653043a4c9", "3": "90c02e99-d4b8-4b42-9e2b-5ba1dedaab43"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "90c02e99-d4b8-4b42-9e2b-5ba1dedaab43": {"__data__": {"text": "those in the Church who would recognize the existence of life from\n[161]\nthe moment of conception.

[Footnote 62]\nIn areas other than criminal abortion, the law has been reluctant to endorse any theory that life, as we recognize it, begins before live birth, or to accord legal rights to the unborn except in narrowly defined situations and except when the rights are contingent upon live birth. For example, the traditional rule of tort law denied recovery for prenatal injuries even though the child was born alive. [Footnote 63] That rule has been changed in almost every jurisdiction. In most States, recovery is said to be permitted only if the fetus was viable, or at least quick, when the injuries were sustained, though few\n[162]\ncourts have squarely so held. [Footnote 64] In a recent development, generally opposed by the commentators, some States permit the parents of a stillborn child to maintain an action for wrongful death because of prenatal injuries. [Footnote 65] Such an action, however, would appear to be one to vindicate the parents' interest and is thus consistent with the view that the fetus, at most, represents only the potentiality of life. Similarly, unborn children have been recognized as acquiring rights or interests by way of inheritance or other devolution of property, and have been represented by guardians ad litem. [Footnote 66] Perfection of the interests involved, again, has generally been contingent upon live birth. In short, the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense.\nX\nIn view of all this, we do not agree that, by adopting one theory of life, Texas may override the rights of the pregnant woman that are at stake. We repeat, however, that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman, whether she be a resident of the State or a nonresident who seeks medical consultation and treatment there, and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life. These interests are separate and distinct. Each grows in substantiality as the woman approaches\n[163]\nterm and, at a point during pregnancy, each becomes \"compelling.\"\nWith respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in the health of the mother, the \"compelling\" point, in the light of present medical knowledge, is at approximately the end of the first trimester. This is so because of the now-established medical fact, referred to above at 149, that, until the end of the first trimester mortality in abortion may be less than mortality in normal childbirth. It follows that, from and after this point, a State may regulate the abortion procedure to the extent that the regulation reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health. Examples of permissible state regulation in this area are requirements as to the qualifications of the person who is to perform the abortion; as to the licensure of that person; as to the facility in which the procedure is to be performed, that is, whether it must be a hospital or may be a clinic or some other place of less-than-hospital status; as to the licensing of the facility; and the like.\nThis means, on the other hand, that, for the period of pregnancy prior to this \"compelling\" point, the attending physician, in consultation with his patient, is free to determine, without regulation by the State, that, in his medical judgment, the patient's pregnancy should be", "doc_id": "90c02e99-d4b8-4b42-9e2b-5ba1dedaab43", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4ce759188d945f9ef11fe634aefeb9a9fee0eeb8103de8e266ea6faae221e648", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1h88X1fim6qGuofDqwn0Kf3_zekWIpFO5JjFaMQxz2QQ"}, "node_info": {"start": 78460, "end": 82525}, "relationships": {"1": "634078de-0cfa-48df-858e-10a777c2eb3e", "2": "0051e7b9-bec3-4705-a756-a4c5b473b5c5", "3": "ab48748b-a7ff-46b6-a982-9826f0606074"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab48748b-a7ff-46b6-a982-9826f0606074": {"__data__": {"text": "point, a State may regulate the abortion procedure to the extent that the regulation reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health.

If that decision is reached, the judgment may be effectuated by an abortion free of interference by the State.\nWith respect to the State's important and legitimate interest in potential life, the \"compelling\" point is at viability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb. State regulation protective of fetal life after viability thus has both logical and biological justifications. If the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion\n[164]\nduring that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.\nMeasured against these standards, Art. 1196 of the Texas Penal Code, in restricting legal abortions to those \"procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother,\" sweeps too broadly. The statute makes no distinction between abortions performed early in pregnancy and those performed later, and it limits to a single reason, \"saving\" the mother's life, the legal justification for the procedure. The statute, therefore, cannot survive the constitutional attack made upon it here.\nThis conclusion makes it unnecessary for us to consider the additional challenge to the Texas statute asserted on grounds of vagueness. See United States v. Vuitch, 402 U.S. at 67-72.\nXI\nTo summarize and to repeat:\n1. A state criminal abortion statute of the current Texas type, that excepts from criminality only a lifesaving procedure on behalf of the mother, without regard to pregnancy stage and without recognition of the other interests involved, is violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician.\n(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.\n(c) For the stage subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life\n[165]\nmay, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\n2. The State may define the term \"physician,\" as it has been employed in the preceding paragraphs of this Part XI of this opinion, to mean only a physician currently licensed by the State, and may proscribe any abortion by a person who is not a physician as so defined.\nIn Doe v. Bolton, post, p. 179, procedural requirements contained in one of the modern abortion statutes are considered. That opinion and this one, of course, are to be read together. [Footnote 67]\nThis holding, we feel, is consistent with the relative weights of the respective interests involved, with the lessons and examples of medical and legal history, with the lenity of the common law, and with the demands of the profound problems of the present day.

[Footnote 67]\nThis holding, we feel, is consistent with the relative weights of the respective interests involved, with the lessons and examples of medical and legal history, with the lenity of the common law, and with the demands of the profound problems of the present day. The decision leaves the State free to place increasing restrictions on abortion as the period of pregnancy lengthens, so long as those restrictions are tailored to the recognized state interests. The decision vindicates the right of the physician to administer medical treatment according to his professional judgment up to the points where important\n[166]\nstate interests provide compelling justifications for intervention. Up to those points, the abortion decision in all its aspects is inherently, and primarily, a medical decision, and basic responsibility for it must rest with the physician. If an individual practitioner abuses the privilege of exercising proper medical judgment, the usual remedies, judicial and intra-professional, are available.\nXII\nOur conclusion that Art. 1196 is unconstitutional means, of course, that the Texas abortion statutes, as a unit, must fall. The exception of Art. 1196 cannot be struck down separately, for then the State would be left with a statute proscribing all abortion procedures no matter how medically urgent the case.\nAlthough the District Court granted appellant Roe declaratory relief, it stopped short of issuing an injunction against enforcement of the Texas statutes. The Court has recognized that different considerations enter into a federal court's decision as to declaratory relief, on the one hand, and injunctive relief, on the other. Zwickler v. Koota, 389 U. S. 241, 252-255 (1967); Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479 (1965). We are not dealing with a statute that, on its face, appears to abridge free expression, an area of particular concern under Dombrowski and refined in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. at 50.\nWe find it unnecessary to decide whether the District Court erred in withholding injunctive relief, for we assume the Texas prosecutorial authorities will give full credence to this decision that the present criminal abortion statutes of that State are unconstitutional.\nThe judgment of the District Court as to intervenor Hallford is reversed, and Dr. Hallford's complaint in intervention is dismissed. In all other respects, the judgment\n[167]\nof the District Court is affirmed. Costs are allowed to the appellee.\nIt is so ordered.\n[For concurring opinion of MR.

[Footnote 1]\nBarely two years later, in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, the Court held a Connecticut birth control law unconstitutional. In view of what had been so recently said in Skrupa, the Court's opinion in Griswold understandably did its best to avoid reliance on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as the ground for decision. Yet the Connecticut law did not violate any provision of the Bill of Rights, nor any other specific provision of the Constitution. [Footnote 2] So it was clear\n[168]\nto me then, and it is equally clear to me now, that the Griswold decision can be rationally understood only as a holding that the Connecticut statute substantively invaded the \"liberty\" that is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. [Footnote 3] As so understood, Griswold stands as one in a long line of pre-Skrupa cases decided under the doctrine of substantive due process, and I now accept it as such.\n\"In a Constitution for a free people, there can be no doubt that the meaning of liberty' must be broad indeed.\" Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 572. The Constitution nowhere mentions a specific right of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life, but the \"liberty\" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment covers more than those freedoms explicitly named in the Bill of Rights. See Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232, 238-239; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 534-535; Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399-400. Cf. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.

This 'liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on.

Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 12; Griswold v. Connecticut, supra; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra; Meyer v. Nebraska, supra. See also Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 166; Skinner v.

Supp. 224, 227 (Conn.1972).\nClearly, therefore, the Court today is correct in holding that the right asserted by Jane Roe is embraced within the personal liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nIt is evident that the Texas abortion statute infringes that right directly. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a more complete abridgment of a constitutional freedom than that worked by the inflexible criminal statute now in force in Texas. The question then becomes whether the state interests advanced to justify this abridgment can survive the \"particularly careful scrutiny\" that the Fourteenth Amendment here requires.\nThe asserted state interests are protection of the health and safety of the pregnant woman, and protection of the potential future human life within her. These are legitimate objectives, amply sufficient to permit a State to regulate abortions as it does other surgical procedures, and perhaps sufficient to permit a State to regulate abortions more stringently, or even to prohibit them in the late stages of pregnancy. But such legislation is not before us, and I think the Court today has thoroughly demonstrated that these state interests cannot constitutionally support the broad abridgment of personal\n[171]\nliberty worked by the existing Texas law.

Accordingly, I join the Court's opinion holding that that law is invalid under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nMR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.\nThe Court's opinion brings to the decision of this troubling question both extensive historical fact and a wealth of legal scholarship. While the opinion thus commands my respect, I find myself nonetheless in fundamental disagreement with those parts of it that invalidate the Texas statute in question, and therefore dissent.\nI\nThe Court's opinion decides that a State may impose virtually no restriction on the performance of abortions during the first trimester of pregnancy. Our previous decisions indicate that a necessary predicate for such an opinion is a plaintiff who was in her first trimester of pregnancy at some time during the pendency of her lawsuit. While a party may vindicate his own constitutional rights, he may not seek vindication for the rights of others. Moose Lodge v. Irvis, 407 U. S. 163 (1972); Sierra, Club v. Morton, 405 U. S. 727 (1972). The Court's statement of facts in this case makes clear, however, that the record in no way indicates the presence of such a plaintiff. We know only that plaintiff Roe at the time of filing her complaint was a pregnant woman; for aught that appears in this record, she may have been in her last trimester of pregnancy as of the date the complaint was filed.\nNothing in the Court's opinion indicates that Texas might not constitutionally apply its proscription of abortion as written to a woman in that stage of pregnancy. Nonetheless, the Court uses her complaint against the Texas statute as a fulcrum for deciding that States may\n[172]\nimpose virtually no restrictions on medical abortions performed during the first trimester of pregnancy. In deciding such a hypothetical lawsuit, the Court departs from the longstanding admonition that it should never \"formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.\" Liverpool, New York & Philadelphia S.S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113 U. S. 33, 39 (1885). See also Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 345 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).\nII\nEven if there were a plaintiff in this case capable of litigating the issue which the Court decides, I would reach a conclusion opposite to that reached by the Court. I have difficulty in concluding, as the Court does, that the right of \"privacy\" is involved in this case. Texas, by the statute here challenged, bars the performance of a medical abortion by a licensed physician on a plaintiff such as Roe. A transaction resulting in an operation such as this is not \"private\" in the ordinary usage of that word. Nor is the \"privacy\" that the Court finds here even a distant relative of the freedom from searches and seizures protected by the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, which the Court has referred to as embodying a right to privacy. Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967).\nIf the Court means by the term \"privacy\" no more than that the claim of a person to be free from unwanted state regulation of consensual transactions may be a form of \"liberty\" protected by the Fourteenth", "doc_id": "88acd2e0-8d43-4a26-8f99-54ece4466d68", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8c88ccbe6ef45f9f24814c7b056d3168de47fc8517b4a8a1779590c0ed3d9f15", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1h88X1fim6qGuofDqwn0Kf3_zekWIpFO5JjFaMQxz2QQ"}, "node_info": {"start": 97629, "end": 101566}, "relationships": {"1": "634078de-0cfa-48df-858e-10a777c2eb3e", "2": "5ccf4892-1719-4ab7-a7c3-567ce13c2edf", "3": "0ce10929-7dfc-40ea-8e0e-48f0b8012adc"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ce10929-7dfc-40ea-8e0e-48f0b8012adc": {"__data__": {"text": "as the Court does, that the right of \"privacy\" is involved in this case.

Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347 (1967).\nIf the Court means by the term \"privacy\" no more than that the claim of a person to be free from unwanted state regulation of consensual transactions may be a form of \"liberty\" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, there is no doubt that similar claims have been upheld in our earlier decisions on the basis of that liberty. I agree with the statement of MR. JUSTICE STEWART in his concurring opinion that the \"liberty,\" against deprivation of which without due process the Fourteenth\n[173]\nAmendment protects, embraces more than the rights found in the Bill of Rights. But that liberty is not guaranteed absolutely against deprivation, only against deprivation without due process of law. The test traditionally applied in the area of social and economic legislation is whether or not a law such as that challenged has a rational relation to a valid state objective. Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483, 491 (1955). The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment undoubtedly does place a limit, albeit a broad one, on legislative power to enact laws such as this. If the Texas statute were to prohibit an abortion even where the mother's life is in jeopardy, I have little doubt that such a statute would lack a rational relation to a valid state objective under the test stated in Williamson, supra. But the Court's sweeping invalidation of any restrictions on abortion during the first trimester is impossible to justify under that standard, and the conscious weighing of competing factors that the Court's opinion apparently substitutes for the established test is far more appropriate to a legislative judgment than to a judicial one.\nThe Court eschews the history of the Fourteenth Amendment in its reliance on the \"compelling state interest\" test. See Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164, 179 (1972) (dissenting opinion). But the Court adds a new wrinkle to this test by transposing it from the legal considerations associated with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to this case arising under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Unless I misapprehend the consequences of this transplanting of the \"compelling state interest test,\" the Court's opinion will accomplish the seemingly impossible feat of leaving this area of the law more confused than it found it.\n[174]\nWhile the Court's opinion quotes from the dissent of Mr. Justice Holmes in Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 74 (1905), the result it reaches is more closely attuned to the majority opinion of Mr. Justice Peckham in that case. As in Lochner and similar cases applying substantive due process standards to economic and social welfare legislation, the adoption of the compelling state interest standard will inevitably require this Court to examine the legislative policies and pass on the wisdom of these policies in the very process of deciding whether a particular state interest put forward may or may not be \"compelling.\" The decision here to break pregnancy into three distinct terms and to outline the permissible restrictions the State may impose in each one, for example, partakes more of judicial legislation than it does of a determination of the intent of the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nThe fact that a majority of the States reflecting, after all, the majority sentiment in those States, have had restrictions on abortions for at least a century is a strong indication, it", "doc_id": "0ce10929-7dfc-40ea-8e0e-48f0b8012adc", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2f4fe0c4633d94cce6da04168c41333387531e731e7417b3750d81939fd88130", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1h88X1fim6qGuofDqwn0Kf3_zekWIpFO5JjFaMQxz2QQ"}, "node_info": {"start": 101639, "end": 105667}, "relationships": {"1": "634078de-0cfa-48df-858e-10a777c2eb3e", "2": "88acd2e0-8d43-4a26-8f99-54ece4466d68", "3": "edc6c932-b2ba-48f3-9931-8f2c25997dd0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "edc6c932-b2ba-48f3-9931-8f2c25997dd0": {"__data__": {"text": "that case.

Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 105 (1934). Even today, when society's views on abortion are changing, the very existence of the debate is evidence that the \"right\" to an abortion is not so universally accepted as the appellant would have us believe.\nTo reach its result, the Court necessarily has had to find within the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment a right that was apparently completely unknown to the drafters of the Amendment. As early as 1821, the first state law dealing directly with abortion was enacted by the Connecticut Legislature. Conn.Stat., Tit. 22, \u00c2\u00a7\u00c2\u00a7 14, 16. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth\n[175]\nAmendment in 1868, there were at least 36 laws enacted by state or territorial legislatures limiting abortion. [Footnote 1] While many States have amended or updated\n[176]\ntheir laws, 21 of the laws on the books in 1868 remain in effect today. [Footnote 3-2] Indeed, the Texas statute struck down today was, as the majority notes, first enacted in 1857,\n[177]\nand \"has remained substantially unchanged to the present time.\" Ante at 119.\nThere apparently was no question concerning the validity of this provision or of any of the other state statutes when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. The only conclusion possible from this history is that the drafters did not intend to have the Fourteenth Amendment withdraw from the States the power to legislate with respect to this matter. \nIII\nEven if one were to agree that the case that the Court decides were here, and that the enunciation of the substantive constitutional law in the Court's opinion were proper, the actual disposition of the case by the Court is still difficult to justify. The Texas statute is struck down in toto, even though the Court apparently concedes that, at later periods of pregnancy Texas might impose these self-same statutory limitations on abortion. My understanding of past practice is that a statute found\n[178]\nto be invalid as applied to a particular plaintiff, but not unconstitutional as a whole, is not simply \"struck down\" but is, instead, declared unconstitutional as applied to the fact situation before the Court. Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S. 356 (1886); Street v. New York, 394 U. S. 576 (1969).\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\nFootnotes\n[Footnote 1]\n\"Article 1191.

The court held that \"the State of Texas has a compelling interest to protect fetal life\"; that Art. 1191 \"is designed to protect fetal life\"; that the Texas homicide statutes, particularly Art. 1205 of the Penal Code, are intended to protect a person \"in existence by actual birth,\" and thereby implicitly recognize other human life that is not \"in existence by actual birth\"; that the definition of human life is for the legislature and not the courts; that Art. 1196 \"is more definite than the District of Columbia statute upheld in [ 402 U. S. ] Vuitch\" (402 U.S. 62); and that the Texas statute \"is not vague and indefinite or overbroad.\" A physician's abortion conviction was affirmed.\nIn Thompson, n. 2, the court observed that any issue as to the burden of proof under the exemption of Art. 1196 \"is not before us.\" But see Veevers v. State, 172 Tex.Cr.R. 162, 168-169, 354 S.W.2d 161, 166-167 (1962). Cf. United States v. Vuitch, 402 U.

His complaint in intervention does not purport to assert a class suit, and makes no reference to any class apart from an allegation that he \"and others similarly situated\" must necessarily guess at the meaning of Art. 1196. His application for leave to intervene goes somewhat further, for it asserts that plaintiff Roe does not adequately protect the interest of the doctor \"and the class of people who are physicians .\u00c2 .\u00c2 . [and] the class of people who are .\u00c2 .\u00c2 . patients.\u00c2 .\u00c2 .\u00c2 .\" The leave application, however, is not the complaint. Despite the District Court's statement to the contrary, 314 F. Supp. at 1225, we fail to perceive the essentials of a class suit in the Hallford complaint.\n[Footnote 8]\nA.

See, for example, Aristotle, Hist.Anim. 7.3.583b; Gen.Anim. 2.3.736, 2.5.741; Hippocrates, Lib. de Nat.Puer., No. 10. Aristotle's thinking derived from his three-stage theory of life: vegetable, animal, rational. The vegetable stage was reached at conception, the animal at \"animation,\" and the rational soon after live birth. This theory, together with the 40/80 day view, came to be accepted by early Christian thinkers.\nThe theological debate was reflected in the writings of St. Augustine, who made a distinction between embryo inanimatus, not yet endowed with a soul, and embryo animatus. He may have drawn upon Exodus 21:22. At one point, however, he expressed the view that human powers cannot determine the point during fetal development at which the critical change occurs. See Augustine, De Origine Animae 4.4 (Pub.Law 44.527). See also W. Reany, The Creation of the Human Soul, c. 2 and 83-86 (1932); Huser, The Crime of Abortion in Canon Law 15 (Catholic Univ. of America, Canon Law Studies No. 162, Washington, D.C.1942).\nGalen, in three treatises related to embryology, accepted the thinking of Aristotle and his followers. Quay 426-427. Later, Augustine on abortion was incorporated by Gratian into the Decretum, published about 1140. Decretum Magistri Gratiani 2.32.2.7 to 2.32.2.10, in 1 Corpus Juris Canonici 1122, 1123 (A. Friedburg, 2d ed. 1879). This Decretal and the Decretals that followed were recognized as the definitive body of canon law until the new Code of 1917.\nFor discussions of the canon law treatment, see Means I, pp. 411-412; Noonan 20-26; Quay 426-430; see also J.

The author examines the two principal precedents cited marginally by Coke, both contrary to his dictum, and traces the treatment of these and other cases by earlier commentators. He concludes that Coke, who himself participated as an advocate in an abortion case in 1601, may have intentionally misstated the law. The author even suggests a reason: Coke's strong feelings against abortion, coupled with his determination to assert common law (secular) jurisdiction to assess penalties for an offense that traditionally had been an exclusively ecclesiastical or canon law crime. See also Lader 78-79, who notes that some scholars doubt that the common law ever was applied to abortion; that the English ecclesiastical courts seem to have lost interest in the problem after 1527; and that the preamble to the English legislation of 1803, 43 Geo. 3, c. 58, \u00c2\u00a7 1, referred to in the text, infra at 136, states that \"no adequate means have been hitherto provided for the prevention and punishment of such offenses.\"\n[Footnote 27]\nCommonwealth v.

Neither physician, hospital, nor hospital personnel shall be required to perform any act violative of personally held moral principles. In these circumstances, good medical practice requires only that the physician or other professional personnel withdraw from the case so long as the withdrawal is consistent with good medical practice.\"\nProceedings of the AMA House of Delegates 220 (June 1970).\n[Footnote 39]\n\"The Principles of Medical Ethics of the AMA do not prohibit a physician from performing an abortion that is performed in accordance with good medical practice and under circumstances that do not violate the laws of the community in which he practices.\"\n\"In the matter of abortions, as of any other medical procedure, the Judicial Council becomes involved whenever there is alleged violation of the Principles of Medical Ethics as established by the House of Delegates.\"\n[Footnote 40]\n\"UNIFORM ABORTION ACT\"\n\"SECTION 1.

Neither in Texas nor in any other State are all abortions prohibited. Despite broad proscription, an exception always exists. The exception contained in Art. 1196, for an abortion procured or attempted by medical advice for the purpose of saving the life of the mother, is typical. But if the fetus is a person who is not to be deprived of life without due process of law, and if the mother's condition is the sole determinant, does not the Texas exception appear to be out of line with the Amendment's command?\nThere are other inconsistencies between Fourteenth Amendment status and the typical abortion statute. It has already been pointed out, n 49, supra, that, in Texas, the woman is not a principal or an accomplice with respect to an abortion upon her. If the fetus is a person, why is the woman not a principal or an accomplice? Further, the penalty for criminal abortion specified by Art. 1195 is significantly less than the maximum penalty for murder prescribed by Art. 1257 of the Texas Penal Code. If the fetus is a person, may the penalties be different?\n[Footnote 55]\nCf. the Wisconsin abortion statute, defining \"unborn child\" to mean \"a human being from the time of conception until it is born alive,\" Wis.Stat. \u00c2\u00a7 940.04(6) (1969), and the new Connecticut statute, Pub.Act No. 1 (May 1972 special session), declaring it to be the public policy of the State and the legislative intent \"to protect and preserve human life from the moment of conception.\"\n[Footnote 56]\nEdelstein 16.\n[Footnote 57]\nLader 97-99; D.

PLANNED PARENTHOOD OF SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA et al.\nNos. 91-744, 91-902.\nArgued April 22, 1992.\nDecided June 29, 1992.\nSyllabus *\nAt issue are five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982: \u00a7 3205, which requires that a woman seeking an abortion give her informed consent prior to the procedure, and specifies that she be provided with certain information at least 24 hours before the abortion is performed; \u00a7 3206, which mandates the informed consent of one parent for a minor to obtain an abortion, but provides a judicial bypass procedure; \u00a7 3209, which commands that, unless certain exceptions apply, a married woman seeking an abortion must sign a statement indicating that she has notified her husband; \u00a7 3203, which defines a \"medical emergency\" that will excuse compliance with the foregoing requirements; and \u00a7\u00a7 3207(b), 3214(a), and 3214(f), which impose certain reporting requirements on facilities providing abortion services. Before any of the provisions took effect, the petitioners, five abortion clinics and a physician representing himself and a class of doctors who provide abortion services, brought this suit seeking a declaratory judgment that each of the provisions was unconstitutional on its face, as well as injunctive relief. The District Court held all the provisions unconstitutional and permanently enjoined their enforcement. The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part, striking down the husband notification provision but upholding the others.\nHeld: The judgment in No. 91-902 is affirmed; the judgment in No. 91-744 is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded.\n947 F.2d 682 (CA3 1991): No. 91-902, affirmed; No. 91-744, affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.\nJustice O'CONNOR, Justice KENNEDY, and Justice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and III, concluding that:\n1. Consideration of the fundamental constitutional question resolved by Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147, principles of institutional integrity, and the rule of stare decisis require that Roe's essential holding be retained and reaffirmed as to each of its three parts: (1) a recognition of a woman's right to choose to have an abortion before fetal viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State, whose previability interests are not strong enough to support an abortion prohibition or the imposition of substantial obstacles to the woman's effective right to elect the procedure; (2) a confirmation of the State's power to restrict abortions after viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies endangering a woman's life or health; and (3) the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child.

Pp. ____.\n(a) A reexamination of the principles that define the woman's rights and the State's authority regarding abortions is required by the doubt this Court's subsequent decisions have cast upon the meaning and reach of Roe's central holding, by the fact that The Chief Justice would overrule Roe, and by the necessity that state and federal courts and legislatures have adequate guidance on the subject. Pp. ____.\n1\n(b) Roe determined that a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy is a \"liberty\" protected against state interference by the substantive component of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Neither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment's adoption marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of such \"liberty.\" Rather, the adjudication of substantive due process claims may require this Court to exercise its reasoned judgment in determining the boundaries between the individual's liberty and the demands of organized society. The Court's decisions have afforded constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, see, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010, procreation, Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655, family relationships, Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645, child rearing and education, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070, and contraception, see, e.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510, and have recognized the right of the individual to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child, Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 453, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 1038, 31 L.Ed.2d 349. Roe's central holding properly invoked the reasoning and tradition of these precedents. Pp. ____.\n2\n(c) Application of the doctrine of stare decisis confirms that Roe's essential holding should be reaffirmed. In reexamining that holding, the Court's judgment is informed by a series of prudential and pragmatic considerations designed to test the consistency of overruling the holding with the ideal of the rule of law, and to gauge the respective costs of reaffirming and overruling. Pp. ____.\n3\n(d) Although Roe has engendered opposition, it has in no sense proven unworkable, representing as it does a simple limitation beyond which a state law is unenforceable. P. ____.\n4\n(e) The Roe rule's limitation on state power could not be repudiated without serious inequity to people who, for two decades of economic and social developments, have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail.

P. ____.\n4\n(e) The Roe rule's limitation on state power could not be repudiated without serious inequity to people who, for two decades of economic and social developments, have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail. The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. The Constitution serves human values, and while the effect of reliance on Roe cannot be exactly measured, neither can the certain costs of overruling Roe for people who have ordered their thinking and living around that case be dismissed. Pp. ____.\n5\n(f) No evolution of legal principle has left Roe's central rule a doctrinal anachronism discounted by society. If Roe is placed among the cases exemplified by Griswold, supra, it is clearly in no jeopardy, since subsequent constitutional developments have neither disturbed, nor do they threaten to diminish, the liberty recognized in such cases. Similarly, if Roe is seen as stating a rule of personal autonomy and bodily integrity, akin to cases recognizing limits on governmental power to mandate medical treatment or to bar its rejection, this Court's post-Roe decisions accord with Roe's view that a State's interest in the protection of life falls short of justifying any plenary override of individual liberty claims. See, e.g., Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. of Health, 497 U.S. 261, ----, 110 S.Ct. 2841, ----, 111 L.Ed.2d 224. Finally, if Roe is classified as sui generis, there clearly has been no erosion of its central determination. It was expressly reaffirmed in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U.S. 416, 103 S.Ct. 2481, 76 L.Ed.2d 687 (Akron I ), and Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 90 L.Ed.2d 779; and, in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490, 109 S.Ct. 3040, 106 L.Ed.2d 410, a majority either voted to reaffirm or declined to address the constitutional validity of Roe's central holding. Pp. ____.\n6\n(g) No change in Roe's factual underpinning has left its central holding obsolete, and none supports an argument for its overruling. Although subsequent maternal health care advances allow for later abortions safe to the pregnant woman, and post-Roe neonatal care developments have advanced viability to a point somewhat earlier, these facts go only to the scheme of time limits on the realization of competing interests. Thus, any later divergences from the factual premises of Roe have no bearing on the validity of its central holding, that viability marks the earliest point at which the State's interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions. The soundness or unsoundness of that constitutional judgment in no sense turns on when viability occurs. Whenever it may occur, its attainment will continue to serve as the critical fact.

In contrast, because neither the factual underpinnings of Roe's central holding nor this Court's understanding of it has changed (and because no other indication of weakened precedent has been shown), the Court could not pretend to be reexamining Roe with any justification beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come out differently from the Roe Court. That is an inadequate basis for overruling a prior case. Pp. ____.\n8\n(i) Overruling Roe's central holding would not only reach an unjustifiable result under stare decisis principles, but would seriously weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a Nation dedicated to the rule of law. Where the Court acts to resolve the sort of unique, intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe, its decision has a dimension not present in normal cases and is entitled to rare precedential force to counter the inevitable efforts to overturn it and to thwart its implementation. Only the most convincing justification under accepted standards of precedent could suffice to demonstrate that a later decision overruling the first was anything but a surrender to political pressure and an unjustified repudiation of the principle on which the Court staked its authority in the first instance. Moreover, the country's loss of confidence in the Judiciary would be underscored by condemnation for the Court's failure to keep faith with those who support the decision at a cost to themselves. A decision to overrule Roe's essential holding under the existing circumstances would address error, if error there was, at the cost of both profound and unnecessary damage to the Court's legitimacy and to the Nation's commitment to the rule of law.

An undue burden exists, and therefore a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place substantial obstacles in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\n11\n(b) Roe's rigid trimester framework is rejected. To promote the State's interest in potential life throughout pregnancy, the State may take measures to ensure that the woman's choice is informed. Measures designed to advance this interest should not be invalidated if their purpose is to persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion. These measures must not be an undue burden on the right.\n12\n(c) As with any medical procedure, the State may enact regulations to further the health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion, but may not impose unnecessary health regulations that present a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion.\n13\n(d) Adoption of the undue burden standard does not disturb Roe's holding that regardless of whether exceptions are made for particular circumstances, a State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability.\n14\n(e) Roe's holding that \"subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother\" is also reaffirmed.

As construed by the Court of Appeals, \u00a7 3203's medical emergency definition is intended to assure that compliance with the State's abortion regulations would not in any way pose a significant threat to a woman's life or health, and thus does not violate the essential holding of Roe, supra, at 164, 93 S.Ct., at 732. Although the definition could be interpreted in an unconstitutional manner, this Court defers to lower federal court interpretations of state law unless they amount to \"plain\" error. Pp. ____.\n17\n2. Section 3209's husband notification provision constitutes an undue burden and is therefore invalid. A significant number of women will likely be prevented from obtaining an abortion just as surely as if Pennsylvania had outlawed the procedure entirely. The fact that \u00a7 3209 may affect fewer than one percent of women seeking abortions does not save it from facial invalidity, since the proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom it is irrelevant. Furthermore, it cannot be claimed that the father's interest in the fetus' welfare is equal to the mother's protected liberty, since it is an inescapable biological fact that state regulation with respect to the fetus will have a far greater impact on the pregnant woman's bodily integrity than it will on the husband. Section 3209 embodies a view of marriage consonant with the common-law status of married women but repugnant to this Court's present understanding of marriage and of the nature of the rights secured by the Constitution.

Pp. ____.\n18\nJustice O'CONNOR, Justice KENNEDY, and Justice SOUTER, joined by Justice STEVENS, concluded in Part V-E that all of the statute's recordkeeping and reporting requirements, except that relating to spousal notice, are constitutional. The reporting provision relating to the reasons a married woman has not notified her husband that she intends to have an abortion must be invalidated because it places an undue burden on a woman's choice. Pp. ____.\n19\nJustice O'CONNOR, Justice KENNEDY, and Justice SOUTER concluded in Parts V-B and V-D that:\n20\n1. Section 3205's informed consent provision is not an undue burden on a woman's constitutional right to decide to terminate a pregnancy. To the extent Akron I, 462 U.S., at 444, 103 S.Ct., at 2500, and Thornburgh, 476 U.S., at 762, 106 S.Ct., at 2179, find a constitutional violation when the government requires, as it does here, the giving of truthful, nonmisleading information about the nature of the abortion procedure, the attendant health risks and those of childbirth, and the \"probable gestational age\" of the fetus, those cases are inconsistent with Roe's acknowledgement of an important interest in potential life, and are overruled. Requiring that the woman be informed of the availability of information relating to the consequences to the fetus does not interfere with a constitutional right of privacy between a pregnant woman and her physician, since the doctor-patient relation is derivative of the woman's position, and does not underlie or override the abortion right. Moreover, the physician's First Amendment rights not to speak are implicated only as part of the practice of medicine, which is licensed and regulated by the State. There is no evidence here that requiring a doctor to give the required information would amount to a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking abortion.\n21\nThe premise behind Akron I's invalidation of a waiting period between the provision of the information deemed necessary to informed consent and the performance of an abortion, id., 462 U.S., at 450, 103 S.Ct., at 2503, is also wrong. Although \u00a7 3205's 24-hour waiting period may make some abortions more expensive and less convenient, it cannot be said that it is invalid on the present record and in the context of this facial challenge. Pp. ____.\n22\n2. Section 3206's one-parent consent requirement and judicial bypass procedure are constitutional. See, e.g., Ohio v.

Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147, is not directly implicated by the Pennsylvania statute, which simply regulates and does not prohibit abortion, a reexamination of the \"fundamental right\" Roe accorded to a woman's decision to abort a fetus, with the concomitant requirement that any state regulation of abortion survive \"strict scrutiny,\" id., at 154-156, 93 S.Ct., at 727-728, is warranted by the confusing and uncertain state of this Court's post-Roe decisional law. A review of post-Roe cases demonstrates both that they have expanded upon Roe in imposing increasingly greater restrictions on the States, see Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 783, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 2190, 90 L.Ed.2d 779 (Burger, C.J., dissenting), and that the Court has become increasingly more divided, none of the last three such decisions having commanded a majority opinion, see Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U.S. 502, 110 S.Ct. 2972, 111 L.Ed.2d 405; Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U.S. 417, 110 S.Ct. 2926, 111 L.Ed.2d 344; Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490, 109 S.Ct. 3040, 106 L.Ed.2d 410. This confusion and uncertainty complicated the task of the Court of Appeals, which concluded that the \"undue burden\" standard adopted by Justice O'CONNOR in Webster and Hodgson governs the present cases. Pp. ____.\n26\n2. The Roe Court reached too far when it analogized the right to abort a fetus to the rights involved in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070; Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042; Loving v.

Because abortion involves the purposeful termination of potential life, the abortion decision must be recognized as sui generis, different in kind from the rights protected in the earlier cases under the rubric of personal or family privacy and autonomy.

Pp. ____.\n27\n3. The undue burden standard adopted by the joint opinion of Justices O'CONNOR, KENNEDY, and SOUTER has no basis in constitutional law and will not result in the sort of simple limitation, easily applied, which the opinion anticipates. To evaluate abortion regulations under that standard, judges will have to make the subjective, unguided determination whether the regulations place \"substantial obstacles\" in the path of a woman seeking an abortion, undoubtedly engendering a variety of conflicting views. The standard presents nothing more workable than the trimester framework the joint opinion discards, and will allow the Court, under the guise of the Constitution, to continue to impart its own preferences on the States in the form of a complex abortion code. Pp. ____.\n28\n4. The correct analysis is that set forth by the plurality opinion in Webster, supra: A woman's interest in having an abortion is a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause, but States may regulate abortion procedures in ways rationally related to a legitimate state interest. P. ____.\n29\n5. Section 3205's requirements are rationally related to the State's legitimate interest in assuring that a woman's consent to an abortion be fully informed. The requirement that a physician disclose certain information about the abortion procedure and its risks and alternatives is not a large burden and is clearly related to maternal health and the State's interest in informed consent. In addition, a State may rationally decide that physicians are better qualified than counselors to impart this information and answer questions about the abortion alternatives' medical aspects. The requirement that information be provided about the availability of paternal child support and state-funded alternatives is also related to the State's informed consent interest and furthers the State's interest in preserving unborn life. That such information might create some uncertainty and persuade some women to forgo abortions only demonstrates that it might make a difference and is therefore relevant to a woman's informed choice. In light of this plurality's rejection of Roe's \"fundamental right\" approach to this subject, the Court's contrary holding in Thornburgh is not controlling here. For the same reason, this Court's previous holding invalidating a State's 24-hour mandatory waiting period should not be followed. The waiting period helps ensure that a woman's decision to abort is a well-considered one, and rationally furthers the State's legitimate interest in maternal health and in unborn life. It may delay, but does not prohibit, abortions; and both it and the informed consent provisions do not apply in medical emergencies. Pp. ____.\n30\n6. The statute's parental consent provision is entirely consistent with this Court's previous decisions involving such requirements.

Pp. ____.\n31\n7. Section 3214(a)'s requirement that abortion facilities file a report on each abortion is constitutional because it rationally furthers the State's legitimate interests in advancing the state of medical knowledge concerning maternal health and prenatal life, in gathering statistical information with respect to patients, and in ensuring compliance with other provisions of the Act, while keeping the reports completely confidential.

For a minor to obtain an abortion, the Act requires the informed consent of one of her parents, but provides for a judicial bypass option if the minor does not wish to or cannot obtain a parent's consent. \u00a7 3206. Another provision of the Act requires that, unless certain exceptions apply, a married woman seeking an abortion must sign a statement indicating that she has notified her husband of her intended abortion. \u00a7 3209. The Act exempts compliance with these three requirements in the event of a \"medical emergency,\" which is defined in \u00a7 3203 of the Act. See \u00a7\u00a7 3203, 3205(a), 3206(a), 3209(c). In addition to the above provisions regulating the performance of abortions, the Act imposes certain reporting requirements on facilities that provide abortion services. \u00a7\u00a7 3207(b), 3214(a), 3214(f).\n40\nBefore any of these provisions took effect, the petitioners, who are five abortion clinics and one physician representing himself as well as a class of physicians who provide abortion services, brought this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Each provision was challenged as unconstitutional on its face. The District Court entered a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the regulations, and, after a 3-day bench trial, held all the provisions at issue here unconstitutional, entering a permanent injunction against Pennsylvania's enforcement of them. 744 F.Supp. 1323 (ED Pa.1990).

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, upholding all of the regulations except for the husband notification requirement. 947 F.2d 682 (1991). We granted certiorari. 502 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 631, 632, 117 L.Ed.2d 104 (1992).\n41\nThe Court of Appeals found it necessary to follow an elaborate course of reasoning even to identify the first premise to use to determine whether the statute enacted by Pennsylvania meets constitutional standards. See 947 F.2d, at 687-698. And at oral argument in this Court, the attorney for the parties challenging the statute took the position that none of the enactments can be upheld without overruling Roe v. Wade. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-6. We disagree with that analysis; but we acknowledge that our decisions after Roe cast doubt upon the meaning and reach of its holding. Further, the CHIEF JUSTICE admits that he would overrule the central holding of Roe and adopt the rational relationship test as the sole criterion of constitutionality. See post, at ----. State and federal courts as well as legislatures throughout the Union must have guidance as they seek to address this subject in conformance with the Constitution. Given these premises, we find it imperative to review once more the principles that define the rights of the woman and the legitimate authority of the State respecting the termination of pregnancies by abortion procedures.\n42\nAfter considering the fundamental constitutional questions resolved by Roe, principles of institutional integrity, and the rule of stare decisis, we are led to conclude this: the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed.\n43\nIt must be stated at the outset and with clarity that Roe's essential holding, the holding we reaffirm, has three parts. First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State. Before viability, the State's interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman's effective right to elect the procedure. Second is a confirmation of the State's power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger a woman's life or health. And third is the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child. These principles do not contradict one another; and we adhere to each.\nII\n44\nConstitutional protection of the woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy derives from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It declares that no State shall \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" The controlling word in the case before us is \"liberty.\" Although a literal reading of the Clause might suggest that it governs only the procedures by which a State may deprive persons of liberty, for at least 105 years, at least since Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U.S. 623, 660-661, 8 S.Ct. 273, 291, 31 L.Ed. 205", "doc_id": "7e334420-c6f4-45ba-9669-a1c41c35e4eb", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "56c293344da401197f1c133bbe0c2910608bf3851cdecf83c5b26fc42086fd7e", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1cIyjKwJ1HNLtQ1UNwFqgb8dycJ4v0RoK_rGl6j6mrWo"}, "node_info": {"start": 35721, "end": 39607}, "relationships": {"1": "319e8fca-81ba-47cb-912b-fef1bacc39a7", "2": "2833924b-afae-478d-ae2c-f927dfeb7359", "3": "dd58e5f7-7ca1-4d4f-ae00-fd0f8f919667"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd58e5f7-7ca1-4d4f-ae00-fd0f8f919667": {"__data__": {"text": "outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child.

Kansas, 123 U.S. 623, 660-661, 8 S.Ct. 273, 291, 31 L.Ed. 205 (1887), the Clause has been understood to contain a substantive component as well, one \"barring certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\" Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 331, 106 S.Ct. 662, 665, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). As Justice Brandeis (joined by Justice Holmes) observed, \"[d]espite arguments to the contrary which had seemed to me persuasive, it is settled that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to matters of substantive law as well as to matters of procedure. Thus all fundamental rights comprised within the term liberty are protected by the Federal Constitution from invasion by the States.\" Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 373, 47 S.Ct. 641, 647, 71 L.Ed. 1095 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring). \"[T]he guaranties of due process, though having their roots in Magna Carta's ' per legem terrae' and considered as procedural safeguards 'against executive usurpation and tyranny,' have in this country 'become bulwarks also against arbitrary legislation.' \" Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 541, 81 S.Ct. 1752, 1776, 6 L.Ed.2d 989 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds) (quoting Hurtado v. California, 110 U.S. 516, 532, 4 S.Ct. 111, 119, 28 L.Ed. 232 (1884)).\n45\nThe most familiar of the substantive liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment are those recognized by the Bill of Rights. We have held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates most of the Bill of Rights against the States. See, e.g., Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 147-148, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 1446, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968). It is tempting, as a means of curbing the discretion of federal judges, to suppose that liberty encompasses no more than those rights already guaranteed to the individual against federal interference by the express provisions of the first eight amendments to the Constitution. See Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 68-92, 67 S.Ct. 1672, 1683-1697, 91 L.Ed. 1903 (1947) (Black, J., dissenting). But of course this Court has never accepted that view.\n46\nIt is also tempting, for the same reason, to suppose that the Due Process Clause protects only those practices, defined at the most specific level, that were protected against government interference by other rules of law when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. See Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.S. 110, 127-128, n. 6, 109 S.Ct. 2333, 2344, n. 6, 105 L.Ed.2d 91 (1989) (opinion of SCALIA, J.). But such a view would be inconsistent with our law.

It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter. We have vindicated this principle before. Marriage is mentioned nowhere in the Bill of Rights and interracial marriage was illegal in most States in the 19th century, but the Court was no doubt correct in finding it to be an aspect of liberty protected against state interference by the substantive component of the Due Process Clause in Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 12, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967) (relying, in an opinion for eight Justices, on the Due Process Clause). Similar examples may be found in Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 94-99, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 2265-2267, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987); in Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678, 684-686, 97 S.Ct. 2010, 2015-2017, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977); in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 481-482, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 1680-1681, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965), as well as in the separate opinions of a majority of the Members of the Court in that case, id., at 486-488, 85 S.Ct., at 1682-1683 (Goldberg, J., joined by Warren, C.J., and Brennan, J., concurring) (expressly relying on due process), id., at 500-502, 85 S.Ct., at 1690-1691 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment) (same), id., at 502-507, 85 S.Ct., at 1691-1694 (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment) (same); in Pierce v.

Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399-403, 43 S.Ct. 625, 627, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923).\n47\nNeither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. See U.S. Const., Amend. 9. As the second Justice Harlan recognized:\n48\n\"[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This 'liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.\" Poe v.

Ullman, supra, 367 U.S., at 543, 81 S.Ct., at 1777 (Harlan, J., dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds).\n49\nJustice Harlan wrote these words in addressing an issue the full Court did not reach in Poe v. Ullman, but the Court adopted his position four Terms later in Griswold v. Connecticut, supra. In Griswold, we held that the Constitution does not permit a State to forbid a married couple to use contraceptives. That same freedom was later guaranteed, under the Equal Protection Clause, for unmarried couples. See Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972). Constitutional protection was extended to the sale and distribution of contraceptives in Carey v. Population Services International, supra. It is settled now, as it was when the Court heard arguments in Roe v. Wade, that the Constitution places limits on a State's right to interfere with a person's most basic decisions about family and parenthood, see Carey v. Population Services International, supra; Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977); Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra; Loving v. Virginia, supra; Griswold v. Connecticut, supra; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra; Meyer v. Nebraska, supra, as well as bodily integrity. See, e.g., Washington v. Harper, 494 U.S. 210, 221-222, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 1036-1037, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990); Winston v.

California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952).\n50\nThe inescapable fact is that adjudication of substantive due process claims may call upon the Court in interpreting the Constitution to exercise that same capacity which by tradition courts always have exercised: reasoned judgment. Its boundaries are not susceptible of expression as a simple rule. That does not mean we are free to invalidate state policy choices with which we disagree; yet neither does it permit us to shrink from the duties of our office. As Justice Harlan observed:\n51\n\"Due process has not been reduced to any formula; its content cannot be determined by reference to any code. The best that can be said is that through the course of this Court's decisions it has represented the balance which our Nation, built upon postulates of respect for the liberty of the individual, has struck between that liberty and the demands of organized society. If the supplying of content to this Constitutional concept has of necessity been a rational process, it certainly has not been one where judges have felt free to roam where unguided speculation might take them.

The balance of which I speak is the balance struck by this country, having regard to what history teaches are the traditions from which it developed as well as the traditions from which it broke. That tradition is a living thing. A decision of this Court which radically departs from it could not long survive, while a decision which builds on what has survived is likely to be sound. No formula could serve as a substitute, in this area, for judgment and restraint.\" Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S., at 542, 81 S.Ct., at 1776 (Harlan, J., dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds).\n52\nSee also Rochin v. California, supra, 342 U.S., at 171-172, 72 S.Ct., at 209 (Frankfurter, J., writing for the Court) (\"To believe that this judicial exercise of judgment could be avoided by freezing 'due process of law' at some fixed stage of time or thought is to suggest that the most important aspect of constitutional adjudication is a function for inanimate machines and not for judges\").\n53\nMen and women of good conscience can disagree, and we suppose some always shall disagree, about the profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage. Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code. The underlying constitutional issue is whether the State can resolve these philosophic questions in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter, except perhaps in those rare circumstances in which the pregnancy is itself a danger to her own life or health, or is the result of rape or incest.\n54\nIt is conventional constitutional doctrine that where reasonable people disagree the government can adopt one position or the other. See, e.g., Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U.S. 726, 83 S.Ct. 1028, 10 L.Ed.2d 93 (1963); Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc., 348 U.S. 483, 75 S.Ct. 461, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955). That theorem, however, assumes a state of affairs in which the choice does not intrude upon a protected liberty. Thus, while some people might disagree about whether or not the flag should be saluted, or disagree about the proposition that it may not be defiled, we have ruled that a State may not compel or enforce one view or the other. See West Virginia State Bd. of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989).\n55\nOur law affords constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education.

Baird, supra, 405 U.S., at 453, 92 S.Ct., at 1038 (emphasis in original). Our precedents \"have respected the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.\" Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166, 64 S.Ct. 438, 442, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944). These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.\n56\nThese considerations begin our analysis of the woman's interest in terminating her pregnancy but cannot end it, for this reason: though the abortion decision may originate within the zone of conscience and belief, it is more than a philosophic exercise. Abortion is a unique act. It is an act fraught with consequences for others: for the woman who must live with the implications of her decision; for the persons who perform and assist in the procedure; for the spouse, family, and society which must confront the knowledge that these procedures exist, procedures some deem nothing short of an act of violence against innocent human life; and, depending on one's beliefs, for the life or potential life that is aborted. Though abortion is conduct, it does not follow that the State is entitled to proscribe it in all instances. That is because the liberty of the woman is at stake in a sense unique to the human condition and so unique to the law. The mother who carries a child to full term is subject to anxieties, to physical constraints, to pain that only she must bear. That these sacrifices have from the beginning of the human race been endured by woman with a pride that ennobles her in the eyes of others and gives to the infant a bond of love cannot alone be grounds for the State to insist she make the sacrifice. Her suffering is too intimate and personal for the State to insist, without more, upon its own vision of the woman's role, however dominant that vision has been in the course of our history and our culture. The destiny of the woman must be shaped to a large extent on her own conception of her spiritual imperatives and her place in society.\n57\nIt should be recognized, moreover, that in some critical respects the abortion decision is of the same character as the decision to use contraception, to which Griswold v. Connecticut, Eisenstadt v. Baird, and Carey v. Population Services International, afford constitutional protection. We have no doubt as to the correctness of those decisions. They support the reasoning in Roe relating to the woman's liberty because they involve personal decisions concerning not only the meaning of procreation but also human responsibility and respect for it. As with abortion, reasonable people will have differences of opinion about these matters.

They support the reasoning in Roe relating to the woman's liberty because they involve personal decisions concerning not only the meaning of procreation but also human responsibility and respect for it. As with abortion, reasonable people will have differences of opinion about these matters. One view is based on such reverence for the wonder of creation that any pregnancy ought to be welcomed and carried to full term no matter how difficult it will be to provide for the child and ensure its well-being. Another is that the inability to provide for the nurture and care of the infant is a cruelty to the child and an anguish to the parent. These are intimate views with infinite variations, and their deep, personal character underlay our decisions in Griswold, Eisenstadt, and Carey. The same concerns are present when the woman confronts the reality that, perhaps despite her attempts to avoid it, she has become pregnant.\n58\nIt was this dimension of personal liberty that Roe sought to protect, and its holding invoked the reasoning and the tradition of the precedents we have discussed, granting protection to substantive liberties of the person. Roe was, of course, an extension of those cases and, as the decision itself indicated, the separate States could act in some degree to further their own legitimate interests in protecting pre-natal life. The extent to which the legislatures of the States might act to outweigh the interests of the woman in choosing to terminate her pregnancy was a subject of debate both in Roe itself and in decisions following it.\n59\nWhile we appreciate the weight of the arguments made on behalf of the State in the case before us, arguments which in their ultimate formulation conclude that Roe should be overruled, the reservations any of us may have in reaffirming the central holding of Roe are outweighed by the explication of individual liberty we have given combined with the force of stare decisis. We turn now to that doctrine.\nIII\nA.\n60\nThe obligation to follow precedent begins with necessity, and a contrary necessity marks its outer limit. With Cardozo, we recognize that no judicial system could do society's work if it eyed each issue afresh in every case that raised it. See B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921). Indeed, the very concept of the rule of law underlying our own Constitution requires such continuity over time that a respect for precedent is, by definition, indispensable. See Powell, Stare Decisis and Judicial Restraint, 1991 Journal of Supreme Court History 13, 16. At the other extreme, a different necessity would make itself felt if a prior judicial ruling should come to be seen so clearly as error that its enforcement was for that very reason doomed.\n61\nEven when the decision to overrule a prior case is not, as in the rare, latter instance, virtually foreordained, it is common wisdom that the rule of stare decisis is not an \"inexorable command,\" and certainly it is not such in every constitutional case, see Burnet v. Coronado Oil Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 405-411, 52 S.Ct. 443, 446-449, 76 L.Ed. 815 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). See also Payne v.

Rumsey, 467 U.S. 203, 212, 104 S.Ct. 2305, 2310, 81 L.Ed.2d 164 (1984). Rather, when this Court reexamines a prior holding, its judgment is customarily informed by a series of prudential and pragmatic considerations designed to test the consistency of overruling a prior decision with the ideal of the rule of law, and to gauge the respective costs of reaffirming and overruling a prior case. Thus, for example, we may ask whether the rule has proved to be intolerable simply in defying practical workability, Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U.S. 111, 116, 86 S.Ct. 258, 261, 15 L.Ed.2d 194 (1965); whether the rule is subject to a kind of reliance that would lend a special hardship to the consequences of overruling and add inequity to the cost of repudiation, e.g., United States v. Title Ins. & Trust Co., 265 U.S. 472, 486, 44 S.Ct. 621, 623, 68 L.Ed. 1110 (1924); whether related principles of law have so far developed as to have left the old rule no more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine, see Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 173-174, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 2371, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989); or whether facts have so changed or come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the old rule of significant application or justification, e.g., Burnet, supra, 285 U.S., at 412, 52 S.Ct., at 449 (Brandeis, J., dissenting).\n62\nSo in this case we may inquire whether Roe's central rule has been found unworkable; whether the rule's limitation on state power could be removed without serious inequity to those who have relied upon it or significant damage to the stability of the society governed by the rule in question; whether the law's growth in the intervening years has left Roe's central rule a doctrinal anachronism discounted by society; and whether Roe's premises of fact have so far changed in the ensuing two decades as to render its central holding somehow irrelevant or unjustifiable in dealing with the issue it addressed.\n63\n* Although Roe has engendered opposition, it has in no sense proven \"unworkable,\" see Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.S. 528, 546, 105 S.Ct. 1005, 1015, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1985), representing as it does a simple limitation beyond which a state law is unenforceable. While Roe has, of course, required judicial assessment of state laws affecting the exercise of the choice guaranteed against government infringement, and although the need for such review will remain as a consequence of today's decision, the required determinations fall within judicial competence.\n2\n64\nThe inquiry into reliance counts the cost of a rule's repudiation as it would fall on those who have relied reasonably on the rule's continued application.

While Roe has, of course, required judicial assessment of state laws affecting the exercise of the choice guaranteed against government infringement, and although the need for such review will remain as a consequence of today's decision, the required determinations fall within judicial competence.\n2\n64\nThe inquiry into reliance counts the cost of a rule's repudiation as it would fall on those who have relied reasonably on the rule's continued application. Since the classic case for weighing reliance heavily in favor of following the earlier rule occurs in the commercial context, see Payne v. Tennessee, supra, --- U.S., at ----, 111 S.Ct., at ----, where advance planning of great precision is most obviously a necessity, it is no cause for surprise that some would find no reliance worthy of consideration in support of Roe.\n65\nWhile neither respondents nor their amici in so many words deny that the abortion right invites some reliance prior to its actual exercise, one can readily imagine an argument stressing the dissimilarity of this case to one involving property or contract. Abortion is customarily chosen as an unplanned response to the consequence of unplanned activity or to the failure of conventional birth control, and except on the assumption that no intercourse would have occurred but for Roe's holding, such behavior may appear to justify no reliance claim. Even if reliance could be claimed on that unrealistic assumption, the argument might run, any reliance interest would be de minimis. This argument would be premised on the hypothesis that reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions.\n66\nTo eliminate the issue of reliance that easily, however, one would need to limit cognizable reliance to specific instances of sexual activity. But to do this would be simply to refuse to face the fact that for two decades of economic and social developments, people have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail. The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. See, e.g., R. Petchesky, Abortion and Woman's Choice 109, 133, n. 7 (rev. ed. 1990). The Constitution serves human values, and while the effect of reliance on Roe cannot be exactly measured, neither can the certain cost of overruling Roe for people who have ordered their thinking and living around that case be dismissed.\n3\n67\nNo evolution of legal principle has left Roe's doctrinal footings weaker than they were in 1973. No development of constitutional law since the case was decided has implicitly or explicitly left Roe behind as a mere survivor of obsolete constitutional thinking.\n68\nIt will be recognized, of course, that Roe stands at an intersection of two lines of decisions, but in whichever doctrinal category one reads the case, the result for present purposes will be the same. The Roe Court itself placed its holding in the succession of cases most prominently exemplified by Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965), see Roe, 410 U.S., at 152-153, 93 S.Ct., at 726.

When it is so seen, Roe is clearly in no jeopardy, since subsequent constitutional developments have neither disturbed, nor do they threaten to diminish, the scope of recognized protection accorded to the liberty relating to intimate relationships, the family, and decisions about whether or not to beget or bear a child.

East Cleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977).\n69\nRoe, however, may be seen not only as an exemplar of Griswold liberty but as a rule (whether or not mistaken) of personal autonomy and bodily integrity, with doctrinal affinity to cases recognizing limits on governmental power to mandate medical treatment or to bar its rejection. If so, our cases since Roe accord with Roe's view that a State's interest in the protection of life falls short of justifying any plenary override of individual liberty claims. Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 278, 110 S.Ct. 2841, ----, 111 L.Ed.2d 224 (1990); cf., e.g., Riggins v.

Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11, 24-30, 25 S.Ct. 358, 360-363, 49 L.Ed. 643 (1905).\n70\nFinally, one could classify Roe as sui generis. If the case is so viewed, then there clearly has been no erosion of its central determination. The original holding resting on the concurrence of seven Members of the Court in 1973 was expressly affirmed by a majority of six in 1983, see Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416, 103 S.Ct. 2481, 76 L.Ed.2d 687 (1983) (Akron I ), and by a majority of five in 1986, see Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 90 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986), expressing adherence to the constitutional ruling despite legislative efforts in some States to test its limits. More recently, in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490, 109 S.Ct. 3040, 106 L.Ed.2d 410 (1989), although two of the present authors questioned the trimester framework in a way consistent with our judgment today, see id., at 518, 109 S.Ct., at 3056 (REHNQUIST, C.J., joined by WHITE, and KENNEDY, JJ.); id., at 529, 109 S.Ct., at 3062 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a majority of the Court either decided to reaffirm or declined to address the constitutional validity of the central holding of Roe.

Even on the assumption that the central holding of Roe was in error, that error would go only to the strength of the state interest in fetal protection, not to the recognition afforded by the Constitution to the woman's liberty. The latter aspect of the decision fits comfortably within the framework of the Court's prior decisions including Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U.S. 535, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942), Griswold, supra, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967), and Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972), the holdings of which are \"not a series of isolated points,\" but mark a \"rational continuum.\" Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S., at 543, 81 S.Ct., at 1777 (Harlan, J., dissenting). As we described in Carey v. Population Services International, supra, the liberty which encompasses those decisions\n72\n\"includes 'the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.' While the outer limits of this aspect of [protected liberty] have not been marked by the Court, it is clear that among the decisions that an individual may make without unjustified government interference are personal decisions 'relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education.' \" Id., 431 U.S., at 684-685, 97 S.Ct., at 2016 (citations omitted).\n73\nThe soundness of this prong of the Roe analysis is apparent from a consideration of the alternative. If indeed the woman's interest in deciding whether to bear and beget a child had not been recognized as in Roe, the State might as readily restrict a woman's right to choose to carry a pregnancy to term as to terminate it, to further asserted state interests in population control, or eugenics, for example.

In any event, because Roe \u00a7 scope is confined by the fact of its concern with postconception potential life, a concern otherwise likely to be implicated only by some forms of contraception protected independently under Griswold and later cases, any error in Roe is unlikely to have serious ramifications in future cases.\n4\n74\nWe have seen how time has overtaken some of Roe's factual assumptions: advances in maternal health care allow for abortions safe to the mother later in pregnancy than was true in 1973, see Akron I, supra, 462 U.S., at 429, n. 11, 103 S.Ct., at 2492, n. 11, and advances in neonatal care have advanced viability to a point somewhat earlier. Compare Roe, 410 U.S., at 160, 93 S.Ct., at 730, with Webster, supra, 492 U.S., at 515-516, 109 S.Ct., at 3055 (opinion of REHNQUIST, C.J.); see Akron I, supra, 462 U.S., at 457, and n. 5, 103 S.Ct., at 2489, and n. 5 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). But these facts go only to the scheme of time limits on the realization of competing interests, and the divergences from the factual premises of 1973 have no bearing on the validity of Roe's central holding, that viability marks the earliest point at which the State's interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions. The soundness or unsoundness of that constitutional judgment in no sense turns on whether viability occurs at approximately 28 weeks, as was usual at the time of Roe, at 23 to 24 weeks, as it sometimes does today, or at some moment even slightly earlier in pregnancy, as it may if fetal respiratory capacity can somehow be enhanced in the future. Whenever it may occur, the attainment of viability may continue to serve as the critical fact, just as it has done since Roe was decided; which is to say that no change in Roe's factual underpinning has left its central holding obsolete, and none supports an argument for overruling it.\n5\n75\nThe sum of the precedential inquiry to this point shows Roe's underpinnings unweakened in any way affecting its central holding. While it has engendered disapproval, it has not been unworkable. An entire generation has come of age free to assume Roe's concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions; no erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy has left Roe's central holding a doctrinal remnant; Roe portends no developments at odds with other precedent for the analysis of personal liberty; and no changes of fact have rendered viability", "doc_id": "aec6e99b-7a98-46b9-82e9-d5ce1167782a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "84352a4f5300a8bc11dfd776593f0f3cdd187ddec085cc318fb950f4d8a3a7da", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1cIyjKwJ1HNLtQ1UNwFqgb8dycJ4v0RoK_rGl6j6mrWo"}, "node_info": {"start": 75020, "end": 78557}, "relationships": {"1": "319e8fca-81ba-47cb-912b-fef1bacc39a7", "2": "3e3b607a-d6c5-4f70-b6f6-5c10d67d614e", "3": "839bc399-e1f7-482a-aa66-61d28665a3f4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "839bc399-e1f7-482a-aa66-61d28665a3f4": {"__data__": {"text": "since Roe was decided; which is to say that no change in Roe's factual underpinning has left its central holding obsolete, and none supports an argument for overruling it.\n5\n75\nThe sum of the precedential inquiry to this point shows Roe's underpinnings unweakened in any way affecting its central holding.

An entire generation has come of age free to assume Roe's concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions; no erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy has left Roe's central holding a doctrinal remnant; Roe portends no developments at odds with other precedent for the analysis of personal liberty; and no changes of fact have rendered viability more or less appropriate as the point at which the balance of interests tips. Within the bounds of normal stare decisis analysis, then, and subject to the considerations on which it customarily turns, the stronger argument is for affirming Roe's central holding, with whatever degree of personal reluctance any of us may have, not for overruling it.\nB\n76\nIn a less significant case, stare decisis analysis could, and would, stop at the point we have reached. But the sustained and widespread debate Roe has provoked calls for some comparison between that case and others of comparable dimension that have responded to national controversies and taken on the impress of the controversies addressed. Only two such decisional lines from the past century present themselves for examination, and in each instance the result reached by the Court accorded with the principles we apply today.\n77\nThe first example is that line of cases identified with Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45, 25 S.Ct. 539, 49 L.Ed. 937 (1905), which imposed substantive limitations on legislation limiting economic autonomy in favor of health and welfare regulation, adopting, in Justice Holmes' view, the theory of laissez-faire. Id., at 75, 25 S.Ct., at 546 (Holmes, J., dissenting). The Lochner decisions were exemplified by Adkins v. Children's Hospital of D.C., 261 U.S. 525, 43 S.Ct. 394, 67 L.Ed. 785 (1923), in which this Court held it to be an infringement of constitutionally protected liberty of contract to require the employers of adult women to satisfy minimum wage standards. Fourteen years later, West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379, 57 S.Ct. 578, 81 L.Ed. 703 (1937), signalled the demise of Lochner by overruling Adkins. In the meantime, the Depression had come and, with it, the lesson that seemed unmistakable to most people by 1937, that the interpretation of contractual freedom protected in Adkins rested on fundamentally false factual assumptions about the capacity of a relatively unregulated market to satisfy minimal levels of human welfare. See West Coast Hotel Co., supra, at 399, 57 S.Ct., at 585. As Justice Jackson wrote of the constitutional crisis of 1937 shortly before he came on the bench, \"The older world of laissez-faire was recognized everywhere outside the Court to be dead.\" R. Jackson, The Struggle for Judicial Supremacy 85 (1941). The facts upon which the earlier case had premised a constitutional resolution of social controversy had proved to be untrue, and history's demonstration of their untruth not only justified but required the new choice of constitutional principle that West Coast Hotel announced. Of course, it was true that the Court lost something by its misperception, or its lack of prescience, and the Court-packing crisis only magnified the loss; but the clear demonstration that the facts of economic life were different from those previously assumed warranted the repudiation of the old law.\n78\nThe second comparison that 20th century history invites is with the cases employing the", "doc_id": "839bc399-e1f7-482a-aa66-61d28665a3f4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c467959c7495f2ca4fe999543f6462d9fecbc8697e34803a4a7eeab8ba43e4b7", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1cIyjKwJ1HNLtQ1UNwFqgb8dycJ4v0RoK_rGl6j6mrWo"}, "node_info": {"start": 78497, "end": 82319}, "relationships": {"1": "319e8fca-81ba-47cb-912b-fef1bacc39a7", "2": "aec6e99b-7a98-46b9-82e9-d5ce1167782a", "3": "aa21bd2b-233c-4a4e-a4fc-bb18147b9487"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa21bd2b-233c-4a4e-a4fc-bb18147b9487": {"__data__": {"text": "before he came on the bench, \"The older world of laissez-faire was recognized everywhere outside the Court to be dead.\" R.

They began with Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256 (1896), holding that legislatively mandated racial segregation in public transportation works no denial of equal protection, rejecting the argument that racial separation enforced by the legal machinery of American society treats the black race as inferior. The Plessy Court considered \"the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff's argument to consist in the assumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it.\" Id., at 551, 16 S.Ct., at 1143. Whether, as a matter of historical fact, the Justices in the Plessy majority believed this or not, see id., at 557, 562, 16 S.Ct., at 1145, 1147 (Harlan, J., dissenting), this understanding of the implication of segregation was the stated justification for the Court's opinion. But this understanding of the facts and the rule it was stated to justify were repudiated in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954). As one commentator observed, the question before the Court in Brown was \"whether discrimination inheres in that segregation which is imposed by law in the twentieth century in certain specific states in the American Union. And that question has meaning and can find an answer only on the ground of history and of common knowledge about the facts of life in the times and places aforesaid.\" Black, The Lawfulness of the Segregation Decisions, 69 Yale L.J. 421, 427 (1960).\n79\nThe Court in Brown addressed these facts of life by observing that whatever may have been the understanding in Plessy's time of the power of segregation to stigmatize those who were segregated with a \"badge of inferiority,\" it was clear by 1954 that legally sanctioned segregation had just such an effect, to the point that racially separate public educational facilities were deemed inherently unequal. 347 U.S., at 494-495, 74 S.Ct., at 691-692. Society's understanding of the facts upon which a constitutional ruling was sought in 1954 was thus fundamentally different from the basis claimed for the decision in 1896. While we think Plessy was wrong the day it was decided, see Plessy, supra, 163 U.S., at 552-564, 16 S.Ct., at 1143-1148 (Harlan, J., dissenting), we must also recognize that the Plessy Court's explanation for its decision was so clearly at odds with the facts apparent to the Court in 1954 that the decision to reexamine Plessy was on this ground alone not only justified but required.\n80\nWest Coast Hotel and Brown each rested on facts, or an understanding of facts, changed from those which furnished the claimed justifications for the earlier constitutional resolutions.

Each case was comprehensible as the Court's response to facts that the country could understand, or had come to understand already, but which the Court of an earlier day, as its own declarations disclosed, had not been able to perceive. As the decisions were thus comprehensible they were also defensible, not merely as the victories of one doctrinal school over another by dint of numbers (victories though they were), but as applications of constitutional principle to facts as they had not been seen by the Court before. In constitutional adjudication as elsewhere in life, changed circumstances may impose new obligations, and the thoughtful part of the Nation could accept each decision to overrule a prior case as a response to the Court's constitutional duty.\n81\nBecause the case before us presents no such occasion it could be seen as no such response. Because neither the factual underpinnings of Roe's central holding nor our understanding of it has changed (and because no other indication of weakened precedent has been shown) the Court could not pretend to be reexamining the prior law with any justification beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come out differently from the Court of 1973. To overrule prior law for no other reason than that would run counter to the view repeated in our cases, that a decision to overrule should rest on some special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided. See, e.g., Mitchell v. W.T. Grant, 416 U.S. 600, 636, 94 S.Ct. 1895, 1914, 40 L.Ed.2d 406 (1974) (Stewart, J., dissenting) (\"A basic change in the law upon a ground no firmer than a change in our membership invites the popular misconception that this institution is little different from the two political branches of the Government. No misconception could do more lasting injury to this Court and to the system of law which it is our abiding mission to serve\"); Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 677, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1703, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting).\nC\n82\nThe examination of the conditions justifying the repudiation of Adkins by West Coast Hotel and Plessy by Brown is enough to suggest the terrible price that would have been paid if the Court had not overruled as it did. In the present case, however, as our analysis to this point makes clear, the terrible price would be paid for overruling. Our analysis would not be complete, however, without explaining why overruling Roe's central holding would not only reach an unjustifiable result under principles of stare decisis, but would seriously weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a Nation dedicated to the rule of law. To understand why this would be so it is necessary to understand the source of this Court's authority, the conditions necessary for its preservation, and its relationship to the country's understanding of itself as a constitutional Republic.\n83\nThe root of American governmental power is revealed most clearly in the instance of the power conferred by the Constitution upon the Judiciary of the United States and specifically upon this Court.

To understand why this would be so it is necessary to understand the source of this Court's authority, the conditions necessary for its preservation, and its relationship to the country's understanding of itself as a constitutional Republic.\n83\nThe root of American governmental power is revealed most clearly in the instance of the power conferred by the Constitution upon the Judiciary of the United States and specifically upon this Court. As Americans of each succeeding generation are rightly told, the Court cannot buy support for its decisions by spending money and, except to a minor degree, it cannot independently coerce obedience to its decrees. The Court's power lies, rather, in its legitimacy, a product of substance and perception that shows itself in the people's acceptance of the Judiciary as fit to determine what the Nation's law means and to declare what it demands.\n84\nThe underlying substance of this legitimacy is of course the warrant for the Court's decisions in the Constitution and the lesser sources of legal principle on which the Court draws. That substance is expressed in the Court's opinions, and our contemporary understanding is such that a decision without principled justification would be no judicial act at all. But even when justification is furnished by apposite legal principle, something more is required. Because not every conscientious claim of principled justification will be accepted as such, the justification claimed must be beyond dispute. The Court must take care to speak and act in ways that allow people to accept its decisions on the terms the Court claims for them, as grounded truly in principle, not as compromises with social and political pressures having, as such, no bearing on the principled choices that the Court is obliged to make. Thus, the Court's legitimacy depends on making legally principled decisions under circumstances in which their principled character is sufficiently plausible to be accepted by the Nation.\n85\nThe need for principled action to be perceived as such is implicated to some degree whenever this, or any other appellate court, overrules a prior case. This is not to say, of course, that this Court cannot give a perfectly satisfactory explanation in most cases. People understand that some of the Constitution's language is hard to fathom and that the Court's Justices are sometimes able to perceive significant facts or to understand principles of law that eluded their predecessors and that justify departures from existing decisions. However upsetting it may be to those most directly affected when one judicially derived rule replaces another, the country can accept some correction of error without necessarily questioning the legitimacy of the Court.\n86\nIn two circumstances, however, the Court would almost certainly fail to receive the benefit of the doubt in overruling prior cases. There is, first, a point beyond which frequent overruling would overtax the country's belief in the Court's good faith. Despite the variety of reasons that may inform and justify a decision to overrule, we cannot forget that such a decision is usually perceived (and perceived correctly) as, at the least, a statement that a prior decision was wrong. There is a limit to the amount of error that can plausibly be imputed to prior courts. If that limit should be exceeded, disturbance of prior rulings would be taken as evidence that justifiable reexamination of principle had given way to drives for particular results in the short term. The legitimacy of the Court would fade with the frequency of its vacillation.\n87\nThat first circumstance can be described as hypothetical; the second is to the point here and now.

The legitimacy of the Court would fade with the frequency of its vacillation.\n87\nThat first circumstance can be described as hypothetical; the second is to the point here and now. Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case in such a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe and those rare, comparable cases, its decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It is the dimension present whenever the Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution.\n88\nThe Court is not asked to do this very often, having thus addressed the Nation only twice in our lifetime, in the decisions of Brown and Roe. But when the Court does act in this way, its decision requires an equally rare precedential force to counter the inevitable efforts to overturn it and to thwart its implementation. Some of those efforts may be mere unprincipled emotional reactions; others may proceed from principles worthy of profound respect. But whatever the premises of opposition may be, only the most convincing justification under accepted standards of precedent could suffice to demonstrate that a later decision overruling the first was anything but a surrender to political pressure, and an unjustified repudiation of the principle on which the Court staked its authority in the first instance. So to overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to reexamine a watershed decision would subvert the Court's legitimacy beyond any serious question. Cf. Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294, 300, 75 S.Ct. 753, 756, 99 L.Ed. 1083 (1955) (Brown II ) (\"[I]t should go without saying that the vitality of th[e] constitutional principles [announced in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954),] cannot be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them\").\n89\nThe country's loss of confidence in the judiciary would be underscored by an equally certain and equally reasonable condemnation for another failing in overruling unnecessarily and under pressure. Some cost will be paid by anyone who approves or implements a constitutional decision where it is unpopular, or who refuses to work to undermine the decision or to force its reversal. The price may be criticism or ostracism, or it may be violence. An extra price will be paid by those who themselves disapprove of the decision's results when viewed outside of constitutional terms, but who nevertheless struggle to accept it, because they respect the rule of law. To all those who will be so tested by following, the Court implicitly undertakes to remain steadfast, lest in the end a price be paid for nothing. The promise of constancy, once given, binds its maker for as long as the power to stand by the decision survives and the understanding of the issue has not changed so fundamentally as to render the commitment obsolete. From the obligation of this promise this Court cannot and should not assume any exemption when duty requires it to decide a case in conformance with the Constitution.

A willing breach of it would be nothing less than a breach of faith, and no Court that broke its faith with the people could sensibly expect credit for principle in the decision by which it did that.\n90\nIt is true that diminished legitimacy may be restored, but only slowly. Unlike the political branches, a Court thus weakened could not seek to regain its position with a new mandate from the voters, and even if the Court could somehow go to the polls, the loss of its principled character could not be retrieved by the casting of so many votes. Like the character of an individual, the legitimacy of the Court must be earned over time. So, indeed, must be the character of a Nation of people who aspire to live according to the rule of law. Their belief in themselves as such a people is not readily separable from their understanding of the Court invested with the authority to decide their constitutional cases and speak before all others for their constitutional ideals. If the Court's legitimacy should be undermined, then, so would the country be in its very ability to see itself through its constitutional ideals. The Court's concern with legitimacy is not for the sake of the Court but for the sake of the Nation to which it is responsible.\n91\nThe Court's duty in the present case is clear. In 1973, it confronted the already-divisive issue of governmental power to limit personal choice to undergo abortion, for which it provided a new resolution based on the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether or not a new social consensus is developing on that issue, its divisiveness is no less today than in 1973, and pressure to overrule the decision, like pressure to retain it, has grown only more intense. A decision to overrule Roe's essential holding under the existing circumstances would address error, if error there was, at the cost of both profound and unnecessary damage to the Court's legitimacy, and to the Nation's commitment to the rule of law. It is therefore imperative to adhere to the essence of Roe's original decision, and we do so today.\nIV\n92\nFrom what we have said so far it follows that it is a constitutional liberty of the woman to have some freedom to terminate her pregnancy. We conclude that the basic decision in Roe was based on a constitutional analysis which we cannot now repudiate. The woman's liberty is not so unlimited, however, that from the outset the State cannot show its concern for the life of the unborn, and at a later point in fetal development the State's interest in life has sufficient force so that the right of the woman to terminate the pregnancy can be restricted.\n93\nThat brings us, of course, to the point where much criticism has been directed at Roe, a criticism that always inheres when the Court draws a specific rule from what in the Constitution is but a general standard. We conclude, however, that the urgent claims of the woman to retain the ultimate control over her destiny and her body, claims implicit in the meaning of liberty, require us to perform that function. Liberty must not be extinguished for want of a line that is clear. And it falls to us to give some real substance to the woman's liberty to determine whether to carry her pregnancy to full term.\n94\nWe conclude the line should be drawn at viability, so that before that time the woman has a right to choose to terminate her pregnancy.

Liberty must not be extinguished for want of a line that is clear. And it falls to us to give some real substance to the woman's liberty to determine whether to carry her pregnancy to full term.\n94\nWe conclude the line should be drawn at viability, so that before that time the woman has a right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. We adhere to this principle for two reasons. First, as we have said, is the doctrine of stare decisis. Any judicial act of line-drawing may seem somewhat arbitrary, but Roe was a reasoned statement, elaborated with great care. We have twice reaffirmed it in the face of great opposition. See Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, 476 U.S., at 759, 106 S.Ct., at 2178; Akron I, 462 U.S., at 419-420, 103 S.Ct., at 2487-2488. Although we must overrule those parts of Thornburgh and Akron I which, in our view, are inconsistent with Roe's statement that the State has a legitimate interest in promoting the life or potential life of the unborn, see infra, at ----, the central premise of those cases represents an unbroken commitment by this Court to the essential holding of Roe. It is that premise which we reaffirm today.\n95\nThe second reason is that the concept of viability, as we noted in Roe, is the time at which there is a realistic possibility of maintaining and nourishing a life outside the womb, so that the independent existence of the second life can in reason and all fairness be the object of state protection that now overrides the rights of the woman. See Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S., at 163, 93 S.Ct., at 731. Consistent with other constitutional norms, legislatures may draw lines which appear arbitrary without the necessity of offering a justification. But courts may not. We must justify the lines we draw. And there is no line other than viability which is more workable. To be sure, as we have said, there may be some medical developments that affect the precise point of viability, see supra, at ----, but this is an imprecision within tolerable limits given that the medical community and all those who must apply its discoveries will continue to explore the matter. The viability line also has, as a practical matter, an element of fairness. In some broad sense it might be said that a woman who fails to act before viability has consented to the State's intervention on behalf of the developing child.\n96\nThe woman's right to terminate her pregnancy before viability is the most central principle of Roe v. Wade. It is a rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce.\n97\nOn the other side of the equation is the interest of the State in the protection of potential life. The Roe Court recognized the State's \"important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.\" Roe, supra, at 162, 93 S.Ct., at 731. The weight to be given this state interest, not the strength of the woman's interest, was the difficult question faced in Roe. We do not need to say whether each of us, had we been Members of the Court when the valuation of the State interest came before it as an original matter, would have concluded, as the Roe Court did, that its weight is insufficient to justify a ban on abortions prior to viability even when it is subject to certain exceptions.

And we have concluded that the essential holding of Roe should be reaffirmed.\n98\nYet it must be remembered that Roe v. Wade speaks with clarity in establishing not only the woman's liberty but also the State's \"important and legitimate interest in potential life.\" Roe, supra, at 163, 93 S.Ct., at 731. That portion of the decision in Roe has been given too little acknowledgement and implementation by the Court in its subsequent cases. Those cases decided that any regulation touching upon the abortion decision must survive strict scrutiny, to be sustained only if drawn in narrow terms to further a compelling state interest. See, e.g., Akron I, supra, 462 U.S., at 427, 103 S.Ct., at 2491. Not all of the cases decided under that formulation can be reconciled with the holding in Roe itself that the State has legitimate interests in the health of the woman and in protecting the potential life within her. In resolving this tension, we choose to rely upon Roe, as against the later cases.\n99\nRoe established a trimester framework to govern abortion regulations. Under this elaborate but rigid construct, almost no regulation at all is permitted during the first trimester of pregnancy; regulations designed to protect the woman's health, but not to further the State's interest in potential life, are permitted during the second trimester; and during the third trimester, when the fetus is viable, prohibitions are permitted provided the life or health of the mother is not at stake. Roe v. Wade, supra, 410 U.S., at 163-166, 93 S.Ct., at 731-733. Most of our cases since Roe have involved the application of rules derived from the trimester framework. See, e.g., Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, supra; Akron I, supra.\n100\nThe trimester framework no doubt was erected to ensure that the woman's right to choose not become so subordinate to the State's interest in promoting fetal life that her choice exists in theory but not in fact. We do not agree, however, that the trimester approach is necessary to accomplish this objective. A framework of this rigidity was unnecessary and in its later interpretation sometimes contradicted the State's permissible exercise of its powers.\n101\nThough the woman has a right to choose to terminate or continue her pregnancy before viability, it does not at all follow that the State is prohibited from taking steps to ensure that this choice is thoughtful and informed. Even in the earliest stages of pregnancy, the State may enact rules and regulations designed to encourage her to know that there are philosophic and social arguments of great weight that can be brought to bear in favor of continuing the pregnancy to full term and that there are procedures and institutions to allow adoption of unwanted children as well as a certain degree of state assistance if the mother chooses to raise the child herself. \" '[T]he Constitution does not forbid a State or city, pursuant to democratic processes, from expressing a preference", "doc_id": "f8311d2a-98c4-4387-a088-fcdbdc77eb2e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "329309cbab99a53dfb6370717a8e7f4f98e8ae804a95e63941a804b58afb39a8", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1cIyjKwJ1HNLtQ1UNwFqgb8dycJ4v0RoK_rGl6j6mrWo"}, "node_info": {"start": 106151, "end": 110125}, "relationships": {"1": "319e8fca-81ba-47cb-912b-fef1bacc39a7", "2": "7e9bdc9c-298e-40cf-94c6-41df9c240fea", "3": "e8749d0e-9336-4f65-8fea-cd77711e2920"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8749d0e-9336-4f65-8fea-cd77711e2920": {"__data__": {"text": "sometimes contradicted the State's permissible exercise of its powers.\n101\nThough the woman has a right to choose to terminate or continue her pregnancy before viability, it does not at all follow that the State is prohibited from taking steps to ensure that this choice is thoughtful and informed.

Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S., at 511, 109 S.Ct., at 3053 (opinion of the Court) (quoting Poelker v. Doe, 432 U.S. 519, 521, 97 S.Ct. 2391, 2392, 53 L.Ed.2d 528 (1977)). It follows that States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound and lasting meaning. This, too, we find consistent with Roe's central premises, and indeed the inevitable consequence of our holding that the State has an interest in protecting the life of the unborn.\n102\nWe reject the trimester framework, which we do not consider to be part of the essential holding of Roe. See Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, supra, 492 U.S., at 518, 109 S.Ct., at 3056 (opinion of REHNQUIST, C.J.); id., at 529, 109 S.Ct., at 3062 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (describing the trimester framework as \"problematic\"). Measures aimed at ensuring that a woman's choice contemplates the consequences for the fetus do not necessarily interfere with the right recognized in Roe, although those measures have been found to be inconsistent with the rigid trimester framework announced in that case. A logical reading of the central holding in Roe itself, and a necessary reconciliation of the liberty of the woman and the interest of the State in promoting prenatal life, require, in our view, that we abandon the trimester framework as a rigid prohibition on all previability regulation aimed at the protection of fetal life. The trimester framework suffers from these basic flaws: in its formulation it misconceives the nature of the pregnant woman's interest; and in practice it undervalues the State's interest in potential life, as recognized in Roe.\n103\nAs our jurisprudence relating to all liberties save perhaps abortion has recognized, not every law which makes a right more difficult to exercise is, ipso facto, an infringement of that right. An example clarifies the point. We have held that not every ballot access limitation amounts to an infringement of the right to vote. Rather, the States are granted substantial flexibility in establishing the framework within which voters choose the candidates for whom they wish to vote. Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 788, 103 S.Ct. 1564, 1569, 75 L.Ed.2d 547 (1983); Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 698, 116 L.Ed.2d 711 (1992).\n104\nThe abortion right is similar.

Population Services International, 431 U.S., at 688, 97 S.Ct., at 2018 (\"[T]he same test must be applied to state regulations that burden an individual's right to decide to prevent conception or terminate pregnancy by substantially limiting access to the means of effectuating that decision as is applied to state statutes that prohibit the decision entirely\").\n106\nThese considerations of the nature of the abortion right illustrate that it is an overstatement to describe it as a right to decide whether to have an abortion \"without interference from the State,\" Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 61, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 2837, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976). All abortion regulations interfere to some degree with a woman's ability to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy. It is, as a consequence, not surprising that despite the protestations contained in the original Roe opinion to the effect that the Court was not recognizing an absolute right, 410 U.S., at 154-155, 93 S.Ct., at 727, the Court's experience applying the trimester framework has led to the striking down of some abortion regulations which in no real sense deprived women of the ultimate decision. Those decisions went too far because the right recognized by Roe is a right \"to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\" Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S., at 453, 92 S.Ct., at 1038. Not all governmental intrusion is of necessity unwarranted; and that brings us to the other basic flaw in the trimester framework: even in Roe's terms, in practice it undervalues the State's interest in the potential life within the woman. Roe v. Wade was express in its recognition of the State's \"important and legitimate interest[s] in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman [and] in protecting the potentiality of human life.\" 410 U.S., at 162, 93 S.Ct., at 731. The trimester framework, however, does not fulfill Roe's own promise that the State has an interest in protecting fetal life or potential life. Roe began the contradiction by using the trimester framework to forbid any regulation of abortion designed to advance that interest before viability. Id., at 163, 93 S.Ct., at 731. Before viability, Roe and subsequent cases treat all governmental attempts to influence a woman's decision on behalf of the potential life within her as unwarranted. This treatment is, in our judgment, incompatible with the recognition that there is a substantial state interest in potential life throughout pregnancy. Cf. Webster, 492 U.S., at 519, 109 S.Ct., at 3057 (opinion of REHNQUIST, C.J.); Akron I, supra, 462 U.S., at 461, 103 S.Ct., at 2509 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting).\n107\nThe very notion that the State has a substantial interest in potential life leads to the conclusion that not all regulations must be deemed unwarranted.

In our view, the undue burden standard is the appropriate means of reconciling the State's interest with the woman's constitutionally protected liberty.\n108\nThe concept of an undue burden has been utilized by the Court as well as individual members of the Court, including two of us, in ways that could be considered inconsistent. See, e.g., Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U.S., at ----, 110 S.Ct., at ---- (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Akron II, 497 U.S., at ----, 110 S.Ct., at ---- (opinion of KENNEDY, J.); Thornburgh v.

Because we set forth a standard of general application to which we intend to adhere, it is important to clarify what is meant by an undue burden.\n109\nA finding of an undue burden is a shorthand for the conclusion that a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus. A statute with this purpose is invalid because the means chosen by the State to further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it. And a statute which, while furthering the interest in potential life or some other valid state interest, has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman's choice cannot be considered a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends. To the extent that the opinions of the Court or of individual Justices use the undue burden standard in a manner that is inconsistent with this analysis, we set out what in our view should be the controlling standard. Cf. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 1454, ----, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991) (attempting to \"define the doctrine of abuse of the writ with more precision\" after acknowledging tension among earlier cases). In our considered judgment, an undue burden is an unconstitutional burden. See Akron II, supra, 497 U.S., at ----, 110 S.Ct., at ---- (opinion of KENNEDY, J.). Understood another way, we answer the question, left open in previous opinions discussing the undue burden formulation, whether a law designed to further the State's interest in fetal life which imposes an undue burden on the woman's decision before fetal viability could be constitutional. See, e.g., Akron", "doc_id": "5052b108-a289-4b74-a1d3-cb7da246cbad", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "05e79ab57c53197c6214620b485b6d62910a331eecdca1cd7f756533d64d8905", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1cIyjKwJ1HNLtQ1UNwFqgb8dycJ4v0RoK_rGl6j6mrWo"}, "node_info": {"start": 120597, "end": 123896}, "relationships": {"1": "319e8fca-81ba-47cb-912b-fef1bacc39a7", "2": "bdc564c1-a9fb-4945-b054-c6ec2b3aa7de", "3": "b414f991-c582-4200-bd5a-da37f44c7dac"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b414f991-c582-4200-bd5a-da37f44c7dac": {"__data__": {"text": "McCleskey v.

See, e.g., Akron I, supra, 462 U.S., at 462-463, 103 S.Ct., at 2509-2510 (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting). The answer is no.\n110\nSome guiding principles should emerge. What is at stake is the woman's right to make the ultimate decision, not a right to be insulated from all others in doing so. Regulations which do no more than create a structural mechanism by which the State, or the parent or guardian of a minor, may express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the woman's exercise of the right to choose. See infra, at ---- - ---- (addressing Pennsylvania's parental consent requirement). Unless it has that effect on her right of choice, a state measure designed to persuade her to choose childbirth over abortion will be upheld if reasonably related to that goal. Regulations designed to foster the health of a woman seeking an abortion are valid if they do not constitute an undue burden.\n111\nEven when jurists reason from shared premises, some disagreement is inevitable. Compare Hodgson, 497 U.S., at ---- - ----, 110 S.Ct., at ---- - ---- (opinion of KENNEDY, J.) with id., at ---- - ----, 110 S.Ct., at ---- - ---- (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment in part). That is to be expected in the application of any legal standard which must accommodate life's complexity. We do not expect it to be otherwise with respect to the undue burden standard. We give this summary:\n112\n(a) To protect the central right recognized by Roe v. Wade while at the same time accommodating the State's profound interest in potential life, we will employ the undue burden analysis as explained in this opinion. An undue burden exists, and therefore a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\n113\n(b) We reject the rigid trimester framework of Roe v. Wade. To promote the State's profound interest in potential life, throughout pregnancy the State may take measures to ensure that the woman's choice is informed, and measures designed to advance this interest will not be invalidated as long as their purpose is to persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion. These measures must not be an undue burden on the right.\n114\n(c) As with any medical procedure, the State may enact regulations to further the health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion. Unnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.\n115\n(d) Our adoption of the undue burden analysis does not disturb the central holding of Roe v. Wade, and we reaffirm that holding. Regardless of whether exceptions are made for particular circumstances, a State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability.\n116\n(e) We also reaffirm Roe's holding that \"subsequent to viability, the State in", "doc_id": "b414f991-c582-4200-bd5a-da37f44c7dac", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fa46d2d12fe45ea74e7569596f1ba2f1c25ba5f09ea87eba3836b94781e11c5e", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1cIyjKwJ1HNLtQ1UNwFqgb8dycJ4v0RoK_rGl6j6mrWo"}, "node_info": {"start": 123918, "end": 127611}, "relationships": {"1": "319e8fca-81ba-47cb-912b-fef1bacc39a7", "2": "5052b108-a289-4b74-a1d3-cb7da246cbad", "3": "574a741f-fb00-4792-9799-590a74b35a78"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "574a741f-fb00-4792-9799-590a74b35a78": {"__data__": {"text": "the woman to choose childbirth over abortion.

Wade, 410 U.S., at 164-165, 93 S.Ct., at 732.\n117\nThese principles control our assessment of the Pennsylvania statute, and we now turn to the issue of the validity of its challenged provisions.\nV\n118\nThe Court of Appeals applied what it believed to be the undue burden standard and upheld each of the provisions except for the husband notification requirement. We agree generally with this conclusion, but refine the undue burden analysis in accordance with the principles articulated above. We now consider the separate statutory sections at issue.\nA.\n119\nBecause it is central to the operation of various other requirements, we begin with the statute's definition of medical emergency. Under the statute, a medical emergency is\n120\n\"[t]hat condition which, on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\" 18 Pa.Cons.Stat. (1990). \u00a7 3203.\n121\nPetitioners argue that the definition is too narrow, contending that it forecloses the possibility of an immediate abortion despite some significant health risks. If the contention were correct, we would be required to invalidate the restrictive operation of the provision, for the essential holding of Roe forbids a State from interfering with a woman's choice to undergo an abortion procedure if continuing her pregnancy would constitute a threat to her health. 410 U.S., at 164, 93 S.Ct., at 732. See also Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S., at 316, 100 S.Ct., at 2687.\n122\nThe District Court found that there were three serious conditions which would not be covered by the statute: preeclampsia, inevitable abortion, and premature ruptured membrane. 744 F.Supp., at 1378. Yet, as the Court of Appeals observed, 947 F.2d, at 700-701, it is undisputed that under some circumstances each of these conditions could lead to an illness with substantial and irreversible consequences. While the definition could be interpreted in an unconstitutional manner, the Court of Appeals construed the phrase \"serious risk\" to include those circumstances. Id., at 701. It stated: \"we read the medical emergency exception as intended by the Pennsylvania legislature to assure that compliance with its abortion regulations would not in any way pose a significant threat to the life or health of a woman.\" Ibid. As we said in Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 499-500, 105 S.Ct. 2794, 2799-2800, 86 L.Ed.2d 394 (1985): \"Normally, . . . we defer to the construction of a state statute given it by the lower federal courts.\" Indeed, we have said that we will defer", "doc_id": "574a741f-fb00-4792-9799-590a74b35a78", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "43233712b8509e9d694c4ea31f5a89bf74b95deac77240818ecbc3acbabe1abb", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1cIyjKwJ1HNLtQ1UNwFqgb8dycJ4v0RoK_rGl6j6mrWo"}, "node_info": {"start": 127505, "end": 131321}, "relationships": {"1": "319e8fca-81ba-47cb-912b-fef1bacc39a7", "2": "b414f991-c582-4200-bd5a-da37f44c7dac", "3": "7ab55f2f-ab72-46a3-adad-60555f1ef153"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ab55f2f-ab72-46a3-adad-60555f1ef153": {"__data__": {"text": "could lead to an illness with substantial and irreversible consequences.

Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 118, 63 S.Ct. 477, 482, 87 L.Ed. 645 (1943). This \" 'reflect[s] our belief that district courts and courts of appeals are better schooled in and more able to interpret the laws of their respective States.' \" Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 482, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 2501, 101 L.Ed.2d 420 (1988) (citation omitted). We adhere to that course today, and conclude that, as construed by the Court of Appeals, the medical emergency definition imposes no undue burden on a woman's abortion right.\nB\n123\nWe next consider the informed consent requirement. 18 Pa. Cons.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 3205. Except in a medical emergency, the statute requires that at least 24 hours before performing an abortion a physician inform the woman of the nature of the procedure, the health risks of the abortion and of childbirth, and the \"probable gestational age of the unborn child.\" The physician or a qualified nonphysician must inform the woman of the availability of printed materials published by the State describing the fetus and providing information about medical assistance for childbirth, information about child support from the father, and a list of agencies which provide adoption and other services as alternatives to abortion. An abortion may not be performed unless the woman certifies in writing that she has been informed of the availability of these printed materials and has been provided them if she chooses to view them.\n124\nOur prior decisions establish that as with any medical procedure, the State may require a woman to give her written informed consent to an abortion. See Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.S., at 67, 96 S.Ct., at 2840. In this respect, the statute is unexceptional. Petitioners challenge the statute's definition of informed consent because it includes the provision of specific information by the doctor and the mandatory 24-hour waiting period. The conclusions reached by a majority of the Justices in the separate opinions filed today and the undue burden standard adopted in this opinion require us to overrule in part some of the Court's past decisions, decisions driven by the trimester framework's prohibition of all previability regulations designed to further the State's interest in fetal life.\n125\nIn Akron I, 462 U.S. 416, 103 S.Ct. 2481, we invalidated an ordinance which required that a woman seeking an abortion be provided by her physician with specific information \"designed to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth.\" Id., at 444, 103 S.Ct., at 2500. As we later described the Akron I holding in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S., at 762, 106 S.Ct., at 2179, there were two purported flaws in the Akron ordinance: the information was designed to dissuade the woman from having an abortion and the ordinance imposed \"a rigid requirement that a specific body of information be given in all cases, irrespective of the particular needs of the patient. . . .\" Ibid.\n126\nTo the extent Akron I and Thornburgh find", "doc_id": "7ab55f2f-ab72-46a3-adad-60555f1ef153", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b8cf07f9c343af1f76caf9ce2bee363c9c779f720de7f3e294ba7c51f36a84c6", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1cIyjKwJ1HNLtQ1UNwFqgb8dycJ4v0RoK_rGl6j6mrWo"}, "node_info": {"start": 131373, "end": 135265}, "relationships": {"1": "319e8fca-81ba-47cb-912b-fef1bacc39a7", "2": "574a741f-fb00-4792-9799-590a74b35a78", "3": "4e46db38-82c6-43d7-bcff-07deaecba268"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e46db38-82c6-43d7-bcff-07deaecba268": {"__data__": {"text": "Akron I, 462 U.S. 416, 103 S.Ct. 2481, we invalidated an ordinance which required that a woman seeking an abortion be provided by her physician with specific information \"designed to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth.\" Id., at 444, 103 S.Ct., at 2500.

This is clear even on the very terms of Akron I and Thornburgh. Those decisions, along with Danforth, recognize a substantial government interest justifying a requirement that a woman be apprised of the health risks of abortion and childbirth. E.g., Danforth, supra, 428 U.S., at 66-67, 96 S.Ct., at 2840. It cannot be questioned that psychological well-being is a facet of health. Nor can it be doubted that most women considering an abortion would deem the impact on the fetus relevant, if not dispositive, to the decision. In attempting to ensure that a woman apprehend the full consequences of her decision, the State furthers the legitimate purpose of reducing the risk that a woman may elect an abortion, only to discover later, with devastating psychological consequences, that her decision was not fully informed. If the information the State requires to be made available to the woman is truthful and not misleading, the requirement may be permissible.\n127\nWe also see no reason why the State may not require doctors to inform a woman seeking an abortion of the availability of materials relating to the consequences to the fetus, even when those consequences have no direct relation to her health. An example illustrates the point. We would think it constitutional for the State to require that in order for there to be informed consent to a kidney transplant operation the recipient must be supplied with information about risks to the donor as well as risks to himself or herself. A requirement that the physician make available information similar to that mandated by the statute here was described in Thornburgh as \"an outright attempt to wedge the Commonwealth's message discouraging abortion into the privacy of the informed-consent dialogue between the woman and her physician.\" 476 U.S., at 762, 106 S.Ct., at 2179. We conclude, however, that informed choice need not be defined in such narrow terms that all considerations of the effect on the fetus are made irrelevant. As we have made clear, we depart from the holdings of Akron I and Thornburgh to the extent that we permit a State to further its legitimate goal of protecting the life of the unborn by enacting legislation aimed at ensuring a decision that is mature and informed, even when in so doing the State expresses a preference for childbirth over abortion. In short, requiring that the woman be informed of the availability of information relating to fetal development and the assistance available should she decide to carry the pregnancy to full term is a reasonable measure to insure an informed choice, one which might cause the woman to choose childbirth over abortion. This requirement cannot be considered a substantial obstacle to obtaining an abortion, and, it follows, there is no undue burden.\n128\nOur prior cases also suggest that the \"straitjacket,\" Thornburgh, supra, at 762, 106 S.Ct., at", "doc_id": "4e46db38-82c6-43d7-bcff-07deaecba268", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2ddf3546ce9695bd7fe903015d0f36a4d3e4ee5299b07ef22f4ba9b55cc19ee9", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1cIyjKwJ1HNLtQ1UNwFqgb8dycJ4v0RoK_rGl6j6mrWo"}, "node_info": {"start": 135239, "end": 139298}, "relationships": {"1": "319e8fca-81ba-47cb-912b-fef1bacc39a7", "2": "7ab55f2f-ab72-46a3-adad-60555f1ef153", "3": "c5eccbba-406d-490f-8589-11bbdf8625b9"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c5eccbba-406d-490f-8589-11bbdf8625b9": {"__data__": {"text": "and Thornburgh to the extent that we permit a State to further its legitimate goal of protecting the life of the unborn by enacting legislation aimed at ensuring a decision that is mature and informed, even when in so doing the State expresses a preference for childbirth over abortion.

This requirement cannot be considered a substantial obstacle to obtaining an abortion, and, it follows, there is no undue burden.\n128\nOur prior cases also suggest that the \"straitjacket,\" Thornburgh, supra, at 762, 106 S.Ct., at 2179 (quoting Danforth, supra, 428 U.S., at 67, n. 8, 96 S.Ct., at 2840, n. 8), of particular information which must be given in each case interferes with a constitutional right of privacy between a pregnant woman and her physician. As a preliminary matter, it is worth noting that the statute now before us does not require a physician to comply with the informed consent provisions \"if he or she can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence, that he or she reasonably believed that furnishing the information would have resulted in a severely adverse effect on the physical or mental health of the patient.\" 18 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 3205 (1990). In this respect, the statute does not prevent the physician from exercising his or her medical judgment.\n129\nWhatever constitutional status the doctor-patient relation may have as a general matter, in the present context it is derivative of the woman's position. The doctor-patient relation does not underlie or override the two more general rights under which the abortion right is justified: the right to make family decisions and the right to physical autonomy. On its own, the doctor-patient relation here is entitled to the same solicitude it receives in other contexts. Thus, a requirement that a doctor give a woman certain information as part of obtaining her consent to an abortion is, for constitutional purposes, no different from a requirement that a doctor give certain specific information about any medical procedure.\n130\nAll that is left of petitioners' argument is an asserted First Amendment right of a physician not to provide information about the risks of abortion, and childbirth, in a manner mandated by the State. To be sure, the physician's First Amendment rights not to speak are implicated, see Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977), but only as part of the practice of medicine, subject to reasonable licensing and regulation by the State. Cf. Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 603, 97 S.Ct. 869, 878, 51 L.Ed.2d 64 (1977). We see no constitutional infirmity in the requirement that the physician provide the information mandated by the State here.\n131\nThe Pennsylvania statute also requires us to reconsider the holding in Akron I that the State may not require that a physician, as opposed to a qualified assistant, provide information relevant to a woman's informed consent. 462 U.S., at 448, 103 S.Ct., at 2502. Since there is no evidence on this record that requiring a doctor to give the information as provided by the statute would amount in practical terms to a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion, we conclude that it is not an undue burden. Our cases reflect the fact that the Constitution gives the States broad latitude to decide that particular functions may be performed only by licensed professionals, even if an objective assessment might suggest that those same tasks could be performed by others. See Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc., 348 U.S. 483, 75 S.Ct. 461, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955).

Thus, we uphold the provision as a reasonable means to insure that the woman's consent is informed.\n132\nOur analysis of Pennsylvania's 24-hour waiting period between the provision of the information deemed necessary to informed consent and the performance of an abortion under the undue burden standard requires us to reconsider the premise behind the decision in Akron I invalidating a parallel requirement. In Akron I we said: \"Nor are we convinced that the State's legitimate concern that the woman's decision be informed is reasonably served by requiring a 24-hour delay as a matter of course.\" 462 U.S., at 450, 103 S.Ct., at 2503. We consider that conclusion to be wrong. The idea that important decisions will be more informed and deliberate if they follow some period of reflection does not strike us as unreasonable, particularly where the statute directs that important information become part of the background of the decision. The statute, as construed by the Court of Appeals, permits avoidance of the waiting period in the event of a medical emergency and the record evidence shows that in the vast majority of cases, a 24-hour delay does not create any appreciable health risk. In theory, at least, the waiting period is a reasonable measure to implement the State's interest in protecting the life of the unborn, a measure that does not amount to an undue burden.\n133\nWhether the mandatory 24-hour waiting period is nonetheless invalid because in practice it is a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to terminate her pregnancy is a closer question. The findings of fact by the District Court indicate that because of the distances many women must travel to reach an abortion provider, the practical effect will often be a delay of much more than a day because the waiting period requires that a woman seeking an abortion make at least two visits to the doctor. The District Court also found that in many instances this will increase the exposure of women seeking abortions to \"the harassment and hostility of anti-abortion protestors demonstrating outside a clinic.\" 744 F.Supp., at 1351. As a result, the District Court found that for those women who have the fewest financial resources, those who must travel long distances, and those who have difficulty explaining their whereabouts to husbands, employers, or others, the 24-hour waiting period will be \"particularly burdensome.\" Id., at 1352.\n134\nThese findings are troubling in some respects, but they do not demonstrate that the waiting period constitutes an undue burden. We do not doubt that, as the District Court held, the waiting period has the effect of \"increasing the cost and risk of delay of abortions,\" id., at 1378, but the District Court did not conclude that the increased costs and potential delays amount to substantial obstacles.

Yet, as we have stated, under the undue burden standard a State is permitted to enact persuasive measures which favor childbirth over abortion, even if those measures do not further a health interest. And while the waiting period does limit a physician's discretion, that is not, standing alone, a reason to invalidate it. In light of the construction given the statute's definition of medical emergency by the Court of Appeals, and the District Court's findings, we cannot say that the waiting period imposes a real health risk.\n135\nWe also disagree with the District Court's conclusion that the \"particularly burdensome\" effects of the waiting period on some women require its invalidation. A particular burden is not of necessity a substantial obstacle. Whether a burden falls on a particular group is a distinct inquiry from whether it is a substantial obstacle even as to the women in that group. And the District Court did not conclude that the waiting period is such an obstacle even for the women who are most burdened by it. Hence, on the record before us, and in the context of this facial challenge, we are not convinced that the 24-hour waiting period constitutes an undue burden.\n136\nWe are left with the argument that the various aspects of the informed consent requirement are unconstitutional because they place barriers in the way of abortion on demand. Even the broadest reading of Roe, however, has not suggested that there is a constitutional right to abortion on demand. See, e.g., Doe v. Bolton, 410 U.S., at 189, 93 S.Ct., at 746. Rather, the right protected by Roe is a right to decide to terminate a pregnancy free of undue interference by the State. Because the informed consent requirement facilitates the wise exercise of that right it cannot be classified as an interference with the right Roe protects. The informed consent requirement is not an undue burden on that right.\nC\n137\nSection 3209 of Pennsylvania's abortion law provides, except in cases of medical emergency, that no physician shall perform an abortion on a married woman without receiving a signed statement from the woman that she has notified her spouse that she is about to undergo an abortion. The woman has the option of providing an alternative signed statement certifying that her husband is not the man who impregnated her; that her husband could not be located; that the pregnancy is the result of spousal sexual assault which she has reported; or that the woman believes that notifying her husband will cause him or someone else to inflict bodily injury upon her. A physician who performs an abortion on a married woman without receiving the appropriate signed statement will have his or her license revoked, and is liable to the husband for damages.\n138\nThe District Court heard the testimony of numerous expert witnesses, and made detailed findings of fact regarding the effect of this statute.

The American Medical Association (AMA) has published a summary of the recent research in this field, which indicates that in an average 12-month period in this country, approximately two million women are the victims of severe assaults by their male partners. In a 1985 survey, women reported that nearly one of every eight husbands had assaulted their wives during the past year. The AMA views these figures as \"marked underestimates,\" because the nature of these incidents discourages women from reporting them, and because surveys typically exclude the very poor, those who do not speak English well, and women who are homeless or in institutions or hospitals when the survey is conducted. According to the AMA, \"[r]esearchers on family violence agree that the true incidence of partner violence is probably double the above estimates; or four million severely assaulted women per year. Studies suggest that from one-fifth to one-third of all women will be physically assaulted by a partner or ex-partner during their lifetime.\" AMA Council on Scientific Affairs, Violence Against Women 7 (1991) (emphasis in original). Thus on an average day in the United States, nearly 11,000 women are severely assaulted by their male partners. Many of these incidents involve sexual assault.

Violence Against Women, supra, at 12.\n163\nOther studies fill in the rest of this troubling picture. Physical violence is only the most visible form of abuse. Psychological abuse, particularly forced social and economic isolation of women, is also common. L. Walker, The Battered Woman Syndrome 27-28 (1984). Many victims of domestic violence remain with their abusers, perhaps because they perceive no superior alternative. Herbert, Silver, & Ellard, Coping with an Abusive Relationship: I. How and Why do Women Stay?, 53 J. Marriage & the Family 311 (1991). Many abused women who find temporary refuge in shelters return to their husbands, in large part because they have no other source of income. Aguirre, Why Do They Return? Abused Wives in Shelters, 30 J.Nat.Assn. of Social Workers 350, 352 (1985). Returning to one's abuser can be dangerous. Recent Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics disclose that 8.8% of all homicide victims in the United States are killed by their spouse. Mercy & Saltzman, Fatal Violence Among Spouses in the United States, 1976-85, 79 Am.J.Public Health 595 (1989). Thirty percent of female homicide victims are killed by their male partners. Domestic Violence: Terrorism in the Home, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Children, Family, Drugs and Alcoholism of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1990).\n164\nThe limited research that has been conducted with respect to notifying one's husband about an abortion, although involving samples too small to be representative, also supports the District Court's findings of fact. The vast majority of women notify their male partners of their decision to obtain an abortion. In many cases in which married women do not notify their husbands, the pregnancy is the result of an extramarital affair. Where the husband is the father, the primary reason women do not notify their husbands is that the husband and wife are experiencing marital difficulties, often accompanied by incidents of violence. Ryan & Plutzer, When Married Women Have Abortions: Spousal Notification and Marital Interaction, 51 J. Marriage & the Family 41, 44 (1989).\n165\nThis information and the District Court's findings reinforce what common sense would suggest. In well-functioning marriages, spouses discuss important intimate decisions such as whether to bear a child. But there are millions of women in this country who are the victims of regular physical and psychological abuse at the hands of their husbands. Should these women become pregnant, they may have very good reasons for not wishing to inform their husbands of their decision to obtain an abortion. Many may have justifiable fears of physical abuse, but may be no less fearful of the consequences of reporting prior abuse to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Many may have a reasonable fear that notifying their husbands will provoke further instances of child abuse; these women are not exempt from \u00a7 3209's notification requirement. Many may fear devastating forms of psychological abuse from their husbands, including verbal harassment, threats of future violence, the destruction of possessions, physical confinement to the home, the withdrawal of financial support, or the disclosure of the abortion to family and friends.

Many may fear devastating forms of psychological abuse from their husbands, including verbal harassment, threats of future violence, the destruction of possessions, physical confinement to the home, the withdrawal of financial support, or the disclosure of the abortion to family and friends. These methods of psychological abuse may act as even more of a deterrent to notification than the possibility of physical violence, but women who are the victims of the abuse are not exempt from \u00a7 3209's notification requirement. And many women who are pregnant as a result of sexual assaults by their husbands will be unable to avail themselves of the exception for spousal sexual assault, \u00a7 3209(b)(3), because the exception requires that the woman have notified law enforcement authorities within 90 days of the assault, and her husband will be notified of her report once an investigation begins. \u00a7 3128(c). If anything in this field is certain, it is that victims of spousal sexual assault are extremely reluctant to report the abuse to the government; hence, a great many spousal rape victims will not be exempt from the notification requirement imposed by \u00a7 3209.\n166\nThe spousal notification requirement is thus likely to prevent a significant number of women from obtaining an abortion. It does not merely make abortions a little more difficult or expensive to obtain; for many women, it will impose a substantial obstacle. We must not blind ourselves to the fact that the significant number of women who fear for their safety and the safety of their children are likely to be deterred from procuring an abortion as surely as if the Commonwealth had outlawed abortion in all cases.\n167\nRespondents attempt to avoid the conclusion that \u00a7 3209 is invalid by pointing out that it imposes almost no burden at all for the vast majority of women seeking abortions. They begin by noting that only about 20 percent of the women who obtain abortions are married. They then note that of these women about 95 percent notify their husbands of their own volition. Thus, respondents argue, the effects of \u00a7 3209 are felt by only one percent of the women who obtain abortions. Respondents argue that since some of these women will be able to notify their husbands without adverse consequences or will qualify for one of the exceptions, the statute affects fewer than one percent of women seeking abortions. For this reason, it is asserted, the statute cannot be invalid on its face. See Brief for Respondents 83-86. We disagree with respondents' basic method of analysis.\n168\nThe analysis does not end with the one percent of women upon whom the statute operates; it begins there. Legislation is measured for consistency with the Constitution by its impact on those whose conduct it affects. For example, we would not say that a law which requires a newspaper to print a candidate's reply to an unfavorable editorial is valid on its face because most newspapers would adopt the policy even absent the law. See Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241, 94 S.Ct. 2831, 41 L.Ed.2d 730 (1974). The proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.\n169\nRespondents' argument itself gives implicit recognition to this principle, at one of its critical points.

Respondents speak of the one percent of women seeking abortions who are married and would choose not to notify their husbands of their plans. By selecting as the controlling class women who wish to obtain abortions, rather than all women or all pregnant women, respondents in effect concede that \u00a7 3209 must be judged by reference to those for whom it is an actual rather than irrelevant restriction. Of course, as we have said, \u00a7 3209's real target is narrower even than the class of women seeking abortions identified by the State: it is married women seeking abortions who do not wish to notify their husbands of their intentions and who do not qualify for one of the statutory exceptions to the notice requirement. The unfortunate yet persisting conditions we document above will mean that in a large fraction of the cases in which \u00a7 3209 is relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion. It is an undue burden, and therefore invalid.\n170\nThis conclusion is in no way inconsistent with our decisions upholding parental notification or consent requirements. See, e.g., Akron II, 497 U.S., at ----, 110 S.Ct., at ----; Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 99 S.Ct. 3035, 61 L.Ed.2d 797 (1979) (Bellotti II ); Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.S., at 74, 96 S.Ct., at 2843. Those enactments, and our judgment that they are constitutional, are based on the quite reasonable assumption that minors will benefit from consultation with their parents and that children will often not realize that their parents have their best interests at heart. We cannot adopt a parallel assumption about adult women.\n171\nWe recognize that a husband has a \"deep and proper concern and interest . . . in his wife's pregnancy and in the growth and development of the fetus she is carrying.\" Danforth, supra, at 69, 96 S.Ct., at 2841. With regard to the children he has fathered and raised, the Court has recognized his \"cognizable and substantial\" interest in their custody. Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651-652, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 1213, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972); see also Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U.S. 246, 98 S.Ct. 549, 54 L.Ed.2d 511 (1978); Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.S. 380, 99 S.Ct. 1760, 60 L.Ed.2d 297 (1979); Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U.S. 248, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983).

It is an inescapable biological fact that state regulation with respect to the child a woman is carrying will have a far greater impact on the mother's liberty than on the father's. The effect of state regulation on a woman's protected liberty is doubly deserving of scrutiny in such a case, as the State has touched not only upon the private sphere of the family but upon the very bodily integrity of the pregnant woman. Cf. Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Dept. of Health, 497 U.S., at 281, 110 S.Ct., at ----. The Court has held that \"when the wife and the husband disagree on this decision, the view of only one of the two marriage partners can prevail. Inasmuch as it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy, as between the two, the balance weighs in her favor.\" Danforth, supra, 428 U.S., at 71, 96 S.Ct., at 2842. This conclusion rests upon the basic nature of marriage and the nature of our Constitution: \"[T]he marital couple is not an independent entity with a mind and heart of its own, but an association of two individuals each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\" Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S., at 453, 92 S.Ct., at 1038 (emphasis in original). The Constitution protects individuals, men and women alike, from unjustified state interference, even when that interference is enacted into law for the benefit of their spouses.\n173\nThere was a time, not so long ago, when a different understanding of the family and of the Constitution prevailed. In Bradwell v. Illinois, 16 Wall. 130, 21 L.Ed. 442 (1873), three Members of this Court reaffirmed the common-law principle that \"a woman had no legal existence separate from her husband, who was regarded as her head and representative in the social state; and, notwithstanding some recent modifications of this civil status, many of the special rules of law flowing from and dependent upon this cardinal principle still exist in full force in most States.\" Id., at 141 (Bradley J., joined by Swayne and Field, JJ., concurring in judgment). Only one generation has passed since this Court observed that \"woman is still regarded as the center of home and family life,\" with attendant \"special responsibilities\" that precluded full and independent legal status under the Constitution. Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.S. 57, 62, 82 S.Ct. 159, 162, 7 L.Ed.2d 118 (1961). These views, of course, are no longer consistent with our understanding of the family, the individual, or the Constitution.\n174\nIn keeping with our rejection of the common-law understanding of a woman's role within the family, the Court held in Danforth that the Constitution does not permit a State to require a married woman to obtain her husband's consent before undergoing an abortion. 428 U.S., at 69, 96 S.Ct., at 2841. The principles that guided the Court in Danforth should be our guides today.

The principles that guided the Court in Danforth should be our guides today. For the great many women who are victims of abuse inflicted by their husbands, or whose children are the victims of such abuse, a spousal notice requirement enables the husband to wield an effective veto over his wife's decision. Whether the prospect of notification itself deters such women from seeking abortions, or whether the husband, through physical force or psychological pressure or economic coercion, prevents his wife from obtaining an abortion until it is too late, the notice requirement will often be tantamount to the veto found unconstitutional in Danforth. The women most affected by this law\u2014those who most reasonably fear the consequences of notifying their husbands that they are pregnant are in the gravest danger.\n175\nThe husband's interest in the life of the child his wife is carrying does not permit the State to empower him with this troubling degree of authority over his wife. The contrary view leads to consequences reminiscent of the common law. A husband has no enforceable right to require a wife to advise him before she exercises her personal choices. If a husband's interest in the potential life of the child outweighs a wife's liberty, the State could require a married woman to notify her husband before she uses a postfertilization contraceptive. Perhaps next in line would be a statute requiring pregnant married women to notify their husbands before engaging in conduct causing risks to the fetus. After all, if the husband's interest in the fetus' safety is a sufficient predicate for state regulation, the State could reasonably conclude that pregnant wives should notify their husbands before drinking alcohol or smoking. Perhaps married women should notify their husbands before using contraceptives or before undergoing any type of surgery that may have complications affecting the husband's interest in his wife's reproductive organs. And if a husband's interest justifies notice in any of these cases, one might reasonably argue that it justifies exactly what the Danforth Court held it did not justify\u2014a requirement of the husband's consent as well. A State may not give to a man the kind of dominion over his wife that parents exercise over their children.\n176\nSection 3209 embodies a view of marriage consonant with the common-law status of married women but repugnant to our present understanding of marriage and of the nature of the rights secured by the Constitution. Women do not lose their constitutionally protected liberty when they marry. The Constitution protects all individuals, male or female, married or unmarried, from the abuse of governmental power, even where that power is employed for the supposed benefit of a member of the individual's family. These considerations confirm our conclusion that \u00a7 3209 is invalid.\nD\n177\nWe next consider the parental consent provision. Except in a medical emergency, an unemancipated young woman under 18 may not obtain an abortion unless she and one of her parents (or guardian) provides informed consent as defined above. If neither a parent nor a guardian provides consent, a court may authorize the performance of an abortion upon a determination that the young woman is mature and capable of giving informed consent and has in fact given her informed consent, or that an abortion would be in her best interests.\n178\nWe have been over most of this ground before. Our cases establish, and we reaffirm today, that a State may require a minor seeking an abortion to obtain the consent of a parent or guardian, provided that there is an adequate judicial bypass procedure. See, e.g., Akron II, 497 U.S., at ----, 110", "doc_id": "46d76ecb-5636-41df-b36d-4909518657b3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a54fa5897024d746be45d7ce9033c740ac512830b5cb7879be30887ad7faa928", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1cIyjKwJ1HNLtQ1UNwFqgb8dycJ4v0RoK_rGl6j6mrWo"}, "node_info": {"start": 174801, "end": 178968}, "relationships": {"1": "319e8fca-81ba-47cb-912b-fef1bacc39a7", "2": "5caed450-a0ea-484b-809d-6a4ad5f7bdb3", "3": "b7bfc54c-6294-433d-a94b-495facd1b19b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7bfc54c-6294-433d-a94b-495facd1b19b": {"__data__": {"text": "next consider the parental consent provision.

Under these precedents, in our view, the one-parent consent requirement and judicial bypass procedure are constitutional.\n179\nThe only argument made by petitioners respecting this provision and to which our prior decisions do not speak is the contention that the parental consent requirement is invalid because it requires informed parental consent. For the most part, petitioners' argument is a reprise of their argument with respect to the informed consent requirement in general, and we reject it for the reasons given above. Indeed, some of the provisions regarding informed consent have particular force with respect to minors: the waiting period, for example, may provide the parent or parents of a pregnant young woman the opportunity to consult with her in private, and to discuss the consequences of her decision in the context of the values and moral or religious principles of their family. See Hodgson, supra, 497 U.S., at ----, 110 S.Ct., at ----.\nE\n180\nUnder the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the statute, every facility which performs abortions is required to file a report stating its name and address as well as the name and address of any related entity, such as a controlling or subsidiary organization. In the case of state-funded institutions, the information becomes public.\n181\nFor each abortion performed, a report must be filed identifying: the physician (and the second physician where required); the facility; the referring physician or agency; the woman's age; the number of prior pregnancies and prior abortions she has had; gestational age; the type of abortion procedure; the date of the abortion; whether there were any pre-existing medical conditions which would complicate pregnancy; medical complications with the abortion; where applicable, the basis for the determination that the abortion was medically necessary; the weight of the aborted fetus; and whether the woman was married, and if so, whether notice was provided or the basis for the failure to give notice. Every abortion facility must also file quarterly reports showing the number of abortions performed broken down by trimester. See 18 Pa.Cons.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 3207, 3214 (1990). In all events, the identity of each woman who has had an abortion remains confidential.\n182\nIn Danforth, 428 U.S., at 80, 96 S.Ct., at 2846, we held that recordkeeping and reporting provisions \"that are reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health and that properly respect a patient's confidentiality and privacy are permissible.\" We think that under this standard, all the provisions at issue here except that relating to spousal notice are constitutional.

Nor do we find that the requirements impose a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice. At most they might increase the cost of some abortions by a slight amount. While at some point increased cost could become a substantial obstacle, there is no such showing on the record before us.\n183\nSubsection (12) of the reporting provision requires the reporting of, among other things, a married woman's \"reason for failure to provide notice\" to her husband. \u00a7 3214(a)(12). This provision in effect requires women, as a condition of obtaining an abortion, to provide the Commonwealth with the precise information we have already recognized that many women have pressing reasons not to reveal. Like the spousal notice requirement itself, this provision places an undue burden on a woman's choice, and must be invalidated for that reason.\nVI\n184\nOur Constitution is a covenant running from the first generation of Americans to us and then to future generations. It is a coherent succession. Each generation must learn anew that the Constitution's written terms embody ideas and aspirations that must survive more ages than one. We accept our responsibility not to retreat from interpreting the full meaning of the covenant in light of all of our precedents. We invoke it once again to define the freedom guaranteed by the Constitution's own promise, the promise of liberty.\n185\n* * *\n186\nThe judgment in No. 91-902 is affirmed.

I shall therefore first comment on significant areas of agreement, and then explain the limited character of my disagreement.\n255\n* The Court is unquestionably correct in concluding that the doctrine of stare decisis has controlling significance in a case of this kind, notwithstanding an individual justice's concerns about the merits.1 The central holding of Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), has been a \"part of our law\" for almost two decades. Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 101, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 2855, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). It was a natural sequel to the protection of individual liberty established in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965). See also Carey v. Population Services Int'l, 431 U.S. 678, 687, 702, 97 S.Ct. 2010, 2017, 2025, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977) (WHITE, J., concurring in part and concurring in result). The societal costs of overruling Roe at this late date would be enormous. Roe is an integral part of a correct understanding of both the concept of liberty and the basic equality of men and women.\n256\nStare decisis also provides a sufficient basis for my agreement with the joint opinion's reaffirmation of Roe's post-viability analysis. Specifically, I accept the proposition that \"[i]f the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.\" 410 U.S., at 163-164, 93 S.Ct., at 732; see ante, at ____.\n257\nI also accept what is implicit in the Court's analysis, namely, a reaffirmation of Roe's explanation of why the State's obligation to protect the life or health of the mother must take precedence over any duty to the unborn.

The Court in Roe carefully considered, and rejected, the State's argument \"that the fetus is a 'person' within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" 410 U.S., at 156, 93 S.Ct., at 728. After analyzing the usage of \"person\" in the Constitution, the Court concluded that that word \"has application only postnatally.\" Id., at 157, 93 S.Ct., at 729. Commenting on the contingent property interests of the unborn that are generally represented by guardians ad litem, the Court noted: \"Perfection of the interests involved, again, has generally been contingent upon live birth. In short, the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense.\" Id., at 162, 93 S.Ct., at 731. Accordingly, an abortion is not \"the termination of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection.\" Id., at 159, 93 S.Ct., at 730. From this holding, there was no dissent, see id., at 173, 93 S.Ct., at 737; indeed, no member of the Court has ever questioned this fundamental proposition. Thus, as a matter of federal constitutional law, a developing organism that is not yet a \"person\" does not have what is sometimes described as a \"right to life.\"2 This has been and, by the Court's holding today, remains a fundamental premise of our constitutional law governing reproductive autonomy.\nII\n258\nMy disagreement with the joint opinion begins with its understanding of the trimester framework established in Roe. Contrary to the suggestion of the joint opinion, ante, at ____, it is not a \"contradiction\" to recognize that the State may have a legitimate interest in potential human life and, at the same time, to conclude that that interest does not justify the regulation of abortion before viability (although other interests, such as maternal health, may). The fact that the State's interest is legitimate does not tell us when, if ever, that interest outweighs the pregnant woman's interest in personal liberty. It is appropriate, therefore, to consider more carefully the nature of the interests at stake.\n259\nFirst, it is clear that, in order to be legitimate, the State's interest must be secular; consistent with the First Amendment the State may not promote a theological or sectarian interest. See Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 778, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 2188, 90 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986) (STEVENS, J., concurring); see generally Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490, 563-572, 109 S.Ct. 3040, 3080-3085, 106 L.Ed.2d 410 (1989) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, as discussed above, the state interest in potential human life is not an interest in loco parentis, for the fetus is not a person.\n260\nIdentifying the State's interests\u2014which the States rarely articulate with any precision\u2014makes clear that the interest in protecting potential life is not grounded in the Constitution. It is, instead, an indirect interest supported by both humanitarian and pragmatic concerns. Many of our citizens believe that any abortion reflects an unacceptable disrespect for potential human life and that the performance of more than a million abortions each year is intolerable; many find third-trimester", "doc_id": "517f54f7-a33e-4f19-af2c-4b916264968c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a5f44c9b07e7e4d2e471779c008b97974bf5c25a8b1d5c774b17ca9284544bf9", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1cIyjKwJ1HNLtQ1UNwFqgb8dycJ4v0RoK_rGl6j6mrWo"}, "node_info": {"start": 210742, "end": 214534}, "relationships": {"1": "319e8fca-81ba-47cb-912b-fef1bacc39a7", "2": "52672b1f-39cb-4e69-a3b7-35202e003fe9", "3": "49321190-e486-463a-ab14-09c824ca6938"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "49321190-e486-463a-ab14-09c824ca6938": {"__data__": {"text": "U.S. 490, 563-572, 109 S.Ct. 3040, 3080-3085, 106 L.Ed.2d 410 (1989) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, as discussed above, the state interest in potential human life is not an interest in loco parentis, for the fetus is not a person.\n260\nIdentifying the State's interests\u2014which the States rarely articulate with any precision\u2014makes clear that the interest in protecting potential life is not grounded in the Constitution. It is, instead, an indirect interest supported by both humanitarian and pragmatic concerns. Many of our citizens believe that any abortion reflects an unacceptable disrespect for potential human life and that the performance of more than a million abortions each year is intolerable; many find third-trimester abortions performed when the fetus is approaching personhood particularly offensive. The State has a legitimate interest in minimizing such offense. The State may also have a broader interest in expanding the population,3 believing society would benefit from the services of additional productive citizens\u2014or that the potential human lives might include the occasional Mozart or Curie. These are the kinds of concerns that comprise the State's interest in potential human life.\n261\nIn counterpoise is the woman's constitutional interest in liberty. One aspect of this liberty is a right to bodily integrity, a right to control one's person. See e.g., Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952); Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 62 S.Ct. 1110, 86 L.Ed. 1655 (1942). This right is neutral on the question of abortion: The Constitution would be equally offended by an absolute requirement that all women undergo abortions as by an absolute prohibition on abortions. \"Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men's minds.\" Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557, 565, 89 S.Ct. 1243, 1248, 22 L.Ed.2d 542 (1969). The same holds true for the power to control women's bodies.\n262\nThe woman's constitutional liberty interest also involves her freedom to decide matters of the highest privacy and the most personal nature. Cf. Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 598-600 (1977). A woman considering abortion faces \"a difficult choice having serious and personal consequences of major importance to her own future\u2014perhaps to the salvation of her own immortal soul.\" Thornburgh, 476 U.S., at 781, 106 S.Ct., at 2189. The authority to make such traumatic and yet empowering decisions is an element of basic human dignity. As the joint opinion so eloquently demonstrates, a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy is nothing less than a matter of conscience.\n263\nWeighing the State's interest in potential life and the woman's liberty interest, I agree with the joint opinion that the State may \" 'expres[s] a preference for normal childbirth,' \" that the State may take steps to ensure that a woman's choice \"is thoughtful and informed,\" and that \"States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound and lasting meaning.\" Ante, at ____. Serious questions arise, however, when a State attempts to \"persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion.\" Ante, at ____.

In general, Roe's requirement that restrictions on abortions before viability be justified by the State's interest in maternal health has prevented States from interjecting regulations designed to influence a woman's decision. Thus, we have upheld regulations of abortion that are not efforts to sway or direct a woman's choice but rather are efforts to enhance the deliberative quality of that decision or are neutral regulations on the health aspects of her decision. We have, for example, upheld regulations requiring written informed consent, see Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976); limited recordkeeping and reporting, see ibid.; and pathology reports, see Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U.S. 476, 103 S.Ct. 2517, 76 L.Ed.2d 733 (1983); as well as various licensing and qualification provisions, see e.g., Roe, 410 U.S., at 150, 93 S.Ct., at 725; Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U.S. 506, 103 S.Ct. 2532, 76 L.Ed.2d 755 (1983). Conversely, we have consistently rejected state efforts to prejudice a woman's choice, either by limiting the information available to her, see Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 95 S.Ct. 2222, 44 L.Ed.2d 600 (1975), or by \"requir[ing] the delivery of information designed 'to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth.' \" Thornburgh, 476 U.S., at 760, 106 S.Ct., 2178; see also Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U.S. 416, 442-449, 103 S.Ct. 2481, 2499-2502, 76 L.Ed.2d 687 (1983).\n265\nIn my opinion, the principles established in this long line of cases and the wisdom reflected in Justice Powell's opinion for the Court in Akron (and followed by the Court just six years ago in Thornburgh ) should govern our decision today. Under these principles, \u00a7\u00a7 3205(a)(2)(i)-(iii) of the Pennsylvania statute are unconstitutional. Those sections require a physician or counselor to provide the woman with a range of materials clearly designed to persuade her to choose not to undergo the abortion. While the State is free, pursuant to \u00a7 3208 of the Pennsylvania law, to produce and disseminate such material, the State may not inject such information into the woman's deliberations just as she is weighing such an important choice.\n266\nUnder this same analysis, \u00a7\u00a7 3205(a)(1)(i) and (iii) of the Pennsylvania statute are constitutional. Those sections, which require the physician to inform a woman of the nature and risks of the abortion procedure and the medical risks of carrying to term, are neutral requirements comparable to those imposed in other medical procedures. Those sections indicate no effort by the State to influence the woman's choice in any way. If anything, such requirements enhance, rather than skew, the woman's decisionmaking.\nIII\n267\nThe 24-hour waiting period required by \u00a7\u00a7", "doc_id": "6f71bbd1-bcb7-4ef6-a037-c4ec7d1fd404", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4e85af986d2dcd901389efa96757f36db3bd620dc2cd9781f24ef1b4e8920904", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1cIyjKwJ1HNLtQ1UNwFqgb8dycJ4v0RoK_rGl6j6mrWo"}, "node_info": {"start": 218263, "end": 221876}, "relationships": {"1": "319e8fca-81ba-47cb-912b-fef1bacc39a7", "2": "49321190-e486-463a-ab14-09c824ca6938", "3": "d4ba5776-1e3c-428b-9aa4-dd80053bda0b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4ba5776-1e3c-428b-9aa4-dd80053bda0b": {"__data__": {"text": "the State is free, pursuant to \u00a7 3208 of the Pennsylvania law, to produce and disseminate such material, the State may not inject such information into the woman's deliberations just as she is weighing such an important choice.\n266\nUnder this same analysis, \u00a7\u00a7 3205(a)(1)(i) and (iii) of the Pennsylvania statute are constitutional.

If anything, such requirements enhance, rather than skew, the woman's decisionmaking.\nIII\n267\nThe 24-hour waiting period required by \u00a7\u00a7 3205(a)(1)-(2) of the Pennsylvania statute raises even more serious concerns. Such a requirement arguably furthers the State's interests in two ways, neither of which is constitutionally permissible.\n268\nFirst, it may be argued that the 24-hour delay is justified by the mere fact that it is likely to reduce the number of abortions, thus furthering the State's interest in potential life. But such an argument would justify any form of coercion that placed an obstacle in the woman's path. The State cannot further its interests by simply wearing down the ability of the pregnant woman to exercise her constitutional right.\n269\nSecond, it can more reasonably be argued that the 24-hour delay furthers the State's interest in ensuring that the woman's decision is informed and thoughtful. But there is no evidence that the mandated delay benefits women or that it is necessary to enable the physician to convey any relevant information to the patient. The mandatory delay thus appears to rest on outmoded and unacceptable assumptions about the decisionmaking capacity of women. While there are well-established and consistently maintained reasons for the State to view with skepticism the ability of minors to make decisions, see Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U.S. 417, 449, 110 S.Ct. 2926, ----, 111 L.Ed.2d 344 (1990),4 none of those reasons applies to an adult woman's decisionmaking ability. Just as we have left behind the belief that a woman must consult her husband before undertaking serious matters, see ante, at ____, so we must reject the notion that a woman is less capable of deciding matters of gravity. Cf. Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 92 S.Ct. 251, 30 L.Ed.2d 225 (1971).\n270\nIn the alternative, the delay requirement may be premised on the belief that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is presumptively wrong. This premise is illegitimate. Those who disagree vehemently about the legality and morality of abortion agree about one thing: The decision to terminate a pregnancy is profound and difficult. No person undertakes such a decision lightly\u2014and States may not presume that a woman has failed to reflect adequately merely because her conclusion differs from the State's preference. A woman who has, in the privacy of her thoughts and conscience, weighed the options and made her decision cannot be forced to reconsider all, simply because the State believes she has come to the wrong conclusion.5\n271\nPart of the constitutional liberty to choose is the equal dignity to which each of us is entitled. A woman who decides to terminate her pregnancy is entitled to the same respect as a woman who decides to carry the fetus to term. The mandatory waiting period denies women that equal respect.\nIV\n272\nIn my opinion, a correct application of the \"undue burden\" standard leads to the same conclusion concerning the constitutionality of these requirements. A state-imposed burden on the exercise of a constitutional right is measured both by its effects and by its character: A burden may be \"undue\" either because the burden is too severe or because it lacks a legitimate, rational", "doc_id": "d4ba5776-1e3c-428b-9aa4-dd80053bda0b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a632ac880e4efb7503a60b1db2265eca73f87fb9487713cae2fca633a42d3677", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1cIyjKwJ1HNLtQ1UNwFqgb8dycJ4v0RoK_rGl6j6mrWo"}, "node_info": {"start": 221913, "end": 225807}, "relationships": {"1": "319e8fca-81ba-47cb-912b-fef1bacc39a7", "2": "6f71bbd1-bcb7-4ef6-a037-c4ec7d1fd404", "3": "c954e731-00f2-49f9-8d52-88ce4dbb633f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "c954e731-00f2-49f9-8d52-88ce4dbb633f": {"__data__": {"text": "weighed the options and made her decision cannot be forced to reconsider all, simply because the State believes she has come to the wrong conclusion.5\n271\nPart of the constitutional liberty to choose is the equal dignity to which each of us is entitled.

A state-imposed burden on the exercise of a constitutional right is measured both by its effects and by its character: A burden may be \"undue\" either because the burden is too severe or because it lacks a legitimate, rational justification.6\n273\nThe 24-hour delay requirement fails both parts of this test. The findings of the District Court establish the severity of the burden that the 24-hour delay imposes on many pregnant women. Yet even in those cases in which the delay is not especially onerous, it is, in my opinion, \"undue\" because there is no evidence that such a delay serves a useful and legitimate purpose. As indicated above, there is no legitimate reason to require a woman who has agonized over her decision to leave the clinic or hospital and return again another day. While a general requirement that a physician notify her patients about the risks of a proposed medical procedure is appropriate, a rigid requirement that all patients wait 24 hours or (what is true in practice) much longer to evaluate the significance of information that is either common knowledge or irrelevant is an irrational and, therefore, \"undue\" burden.\n274\nThe counseling provisions are similarly infirm. Whenever government commands private citizens to speak or to listen, careful review of the justification for that command is particularly appropriate. In this case, the Pennsylvania statute directs that counselors provide women seeking abortions with information concerning alternatives to abortion, the availability of medical assistance benefits, and the possibility of child-support payments. \u00a7\u00a7 3205(a)(2)(i)-(iii). The statute requires that this information be given to all women seeking abortions, including those for whom such information is clearly useless, such as those who are married, those who have undergone the procedure in the past and are fully aware of the options, and those who are fully convinced that abortion is their only reasonable option. Moreover, the statute requires physicians to inform all of their patients of \"the probable gestational age of the unborn child.\" \u00a7 3205(a)(1)(ii). This information is of little decisional value in most cases, because 90% of all abortions are performed during the first trimester7 when fetal age has less relevance than when the fetus nears viability. Nor can the information required by the statute be justified as relevant to any \"philosophic\" or \"social\" argument, ante, at ____, either favoring or disfavoring the abortion decision in a particular case. In light of all of these facts, I conclude that the information requirements in \u00a7 3205(a)(1)(ii) and \u00a7\u00a7 3205(a)(2)(i)-(iii) do not serve a useful purpose and thus constitute an unnecessary\u2014and therefore undue \u2014burden on the woman's constitutional liberty to decide to terminate her pregnancy.\n275\nAccordingly, while I disagree with Parts IV, V-B, and V-D of the joint opinion,8 I join the remainder of the Court's opinion.\n\n", "doc_id": "c954e731-00f2-49f9-8d52-88ce4dbb633f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7ebcc3187bac67ed4754838506fb907c2d41d3536fd0715b60d135ed37762d7e", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1cIyjKwJ1HNLtQ1UNwFqgb8dycJ4v0RoK_rGl6j6mrWo"}, "node_info": {"start": 225651, "end": 229204}, "relationships": {"1": "319e8fca-81ba-47cb-912b-fef1bacc39a7", "2": "d4ba5776-1e3c-428b-9aa4-dd80053bda0b"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7de92c60-9a7a-4786-9691-e7d4c9882543": {"__data__": {"text": "SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \nDOBBS, STATE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, ET AL. v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION ET AL. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT No. 19\u20131392. Argued December 1, 2021\u2014Decided June 24, 2022\n\n[June 24, 2022]\n\n\u2003Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u2003Abortion presents a profound moral issue on which Americans hold sharply conflicting views. Some believe fervently that a human person comes into being at conception and that abortion ends an innocent life. Others feel just as strongly that any regulation of abortion invades a woman\u2019s right to control her own body and prevents women from achieving full equality. Still others in a third group think that abortion should be allowed under some but not all circumstances, and those within this group hold a variety of views about the particular restrictions that should be imposed.\n\u2003For the first 185 years after the adoption of the Constitution, each State was permitted to address this issue in accordance with the views of its citizens. Then, in 1973, this Court decided Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113. Even though the Constitution makes no mention of abortion, the Court held that it confers a broad right to obtain one. It did not claim that American law or the common law had ever recognized  such a right, and its survey of history ranged from the constitutionally irrelevant (e.g., its discussion of abortion in antiquity) to the plainly incorrect (e.g., its assertion that abortion was probably never a crime under the common law). After cataloging a wealth of other information having no bearing on the meaning of the Constitution, the opinion concluded with a numbered set of rules much like those that might be found in a statute enacted by a legislature.\n\u2003Under this scheme, each trimester of pregnancy was regulated differently, but the most critical line was drawn at roughly the end of the second trimester, which, at the time, corresponded to the point at which a fetus was thought to achieve \u201cviability,\u201d i.e., the ability to survive outside the womb. Although the Court acknowledged that States had a legitimate interest in protecting \u201cpotential life,\u201d1 it found that this interest could not justify any restriction on pre-viability abortions. The Court did not explain the basis for this line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard to defend Roe\u2019s reasoning. One prominent constitutional scholar wrote that he \u201cwould vote for a statute very much like the one the Court end[ed] up drafting\u201d if he were \u201ca legislator,\u201d but his assessment of Roe was memorable and brutal: Roe was \u201cnot constitutional law\u201d at all and gave \u201calmost no sense of an obligation to try to be.\u201d2\n\u2003At the time of Roe, 30 States still prohibited abortion at all stages. In the years prior to that decision, about a third of the States had liberalized their laws, but Roe abruptly ended that political process. It imposed the same highly restrictive regime on the entire Nation, and it effectively struck down the abortion laws of every single State.3 As Justice Byron White aptly put it in his dissent, the decision  represented the \u201cexercise of raw judicial power,\u201d 410 U. S., at 222, and it sparked a national controversy that has embittered our political culture for a half century.4\n\u2003Eventually, in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992), the Court revisited Roe, but the Members of the Court split three ways. Two Justices expressed no desire to change Roe in any way.5 Four others wanted to overrule the decision in its entirety.6 And the three remaining Justices, who jointly signed the controlling opinion, took a third position.7", "doc_id": "7de92c60-9a7a-4786-9691-e7d4c9882543", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e4a4570ebfb5e9cd156bcefe0d7cddeee6253574d7ed96e47ed1cde9b1453e37", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1OYyXhZ3vZt9_hN-_PLRYwAEaghAchk7S-vdoY4B_jVs"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3722}, "relationships": {"1": "61de6981-d5d9-46cd-b938-eadee7a82e6b", "3": "ad7e6bcd-3fbc-4f80-aae3-8cd18f981d64"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad7e6bcd-3fbc-4f80-aae3-8cd18f981d64": {"__data__": {"text": "highly restrictive regime on the entire Nation, and it effectively struck down the abortion laws of every single State.3 As Justice Byron White aptly put it in his dissent, the decision  represented the \u201cexercise of raw judicial power,\u201d 410 U.

Two Justices expressed no desire to change Roe in any way.5 Four others wanted to overrule the decision in its entirety.6 And the three remaining Justices, who jointly signed the controlling opinion, took a third position.7 Their opinion did not endorse Roe\u2019s reasoning, and it even hinted that one or more of its authors might have \u201creservations\u201d about whether the Constitution protects a right to abortion.8 But the opinion concluded that stare decisis, which calls for prior decisions to be followed in most instances, required adherence to what it called Roe\u2019s \u201ccentral holding\u201d\u2014that a State may not constitutionally protect fetal life before \u201cviability\u201d\u2014even if that holding was wrong.9 Anything less, the opinion claimed, would undermine respect for this Court and the rule of law.\n\u2003Paradoxically, the judgment in Casey did a fair amount of overruling. Several important abortion decisions were  overruled in toto, and Roe itself was overruled in part.10 Casey threw out Roe\u2019s trimester scheme and substituted a new rule of uncertain origin under which States were forbidden to adopt any regulation that imposed an \u201cundue burden\u201d on a woman\u2019s right to have an abortion.11 The decision provided no clear guidance about the difference between a \u201cdue\u201d and an \u201cundue\u201d burden. But the three Justices who authored the controlling opinion \u201ccall[ed] the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division\u201d by treating the Court\u2019s decision as the final settlement of the question of the constitutional right to abortion.12\n\u2003As has become increasingly apparent in the intervening years, Casey did not achieve that goal. Americans continue to hold passionate and widely divergent views on abortion, and state legislatures have acted accordingly. Some have recently enacted laws allowing abortion, with few restrictions, at all stages of pregnancy. Others have tightly restricted abortion beginning well before viability. And in this case, 26 States have expressly asked this Court to overrule Roe and Casey and allow the States to regulate or prohibit pre-viability abortions.\n\u2003Before us now is one such state law. The State of Mississippi asks us to uphold the constitutionality of a law that generally prohibits an abortion after the 15th week of pregnancy\u2014several weeks before the point at which a fetus is now regarded as \u201cviable\u201d outside the womb. In defending this law, the State\u2019s primary argument is that we should reconsider and overrule Roe and Casey and once again allow each State to regulate abortion as its citizens wish. On the other side, respondents and the Solicitor General ask us to  reaffirm Roe and Casey, and they contend that the Mississippi law cannot stand if we do so. Allowing Mississippi to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, they argue, \u201cwould be no different than overruling Casey and Roe entirely.\u201d Brief for Respondents 43. They contend that \u201cno half-measures\u201d are available and that we must either reaffirm or overrule Roe and Casey. Brief for Respondents 50.\n\u2003We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled.

The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely\u2014the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That provision has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u201d and \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u2003The right to abortion does not fall within this category. Until the latter part of the 20th century, such a right was entirely unknown in American law. Indeed, when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three quarters of the States made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy. The abortion right is also critically different from any other right that this Court has held to fall within the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of \u201cliberty.\u201d Roe\u2019s defenders characterize the abortion right as similar to the rights recognized in past decisions involving matters such as intimate sexual relations, contraception, and marriage, but abortion is fundamentally different, as both Roe and Casey acknowledged, because it destroys what those decisions called \u201cfetal life\u201d and what the law now before us describes as an \u201cunborn human being.\u201d13\n\u2003Stare decisis, the doctrine on which Casey\u2019s controlling  opinion was based, does not compel unending adherence to Roe\u2019s abuse of judicial authority. Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.\n\u2003It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people\u2019s elected representatives. \u201cThe permissibility of abortion, and the limitations, upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting.\u201d Casey, 505 U. S., at 979 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). That is what the Constitution and the rule of law demand.\nI\n\u2003The law at issue in this case, Mississippi\u2019s Gestational Age Act, see Miss.

On the day the Gestational Age Act was enacted, respondents filed suit in Federal District Court against various Mississippi officials, alleging that the Act violated this Court\u2019s precedents establishing a constitutional right to abortion. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents  and permanently enjoined enforcement of the Act, reasoning that \u201cviability marks the earliest point at which the State\u2019s interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions\u201d and that 15 weeks\u2019 gestational age is \u201cprior to viability.\u201d Jackson Women\u2019s Health Org. v.

They tell us that \u201cno half-measures\u201d are available: We must either reaffirm or overrule Roe and Casey. Brief for Respondents 50.\nII\n\u2003We begin by considering the critical question whether the Constitution, properly understood, confers a right to obtain an abortion. Skipping over that question, the controlling opinion in Casey reaffirmed Roe\u2019s \u201ccentral holding\u201d based solely on the doctrine of stare decisis, but as we will explain, proper application of stare decisis required an assessment of the strength of the grounds on which Roe was based. See infra, at 45\u201356.\n\u2003We therefore turn to the question that the Casey plurality did not consider, and we address that question in three steps. First, we explain the standard that our cases have used in determining whether the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s reference to \u201cliberty\u201d protects a particular right. Second, we examine whether the right at issue in this case is rooted  in our Nation\u2019s history and tradition and whether it is an essential component of what we have described as \u201cordered liberty.\u201d Finally, we consider whether a right to obtain an abortion is part of a broader entrenched right that is supported by other precedents.\nA\n1\n\u2003Constitutional analysis must begin with \u201cthe language of the instrument,\u201d Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 186\u2013189 (1824), which offers a \u201cfixed standard\u201d for ascertaining what our founding document means, 1 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a7399, p. 383 (1833). The Constitution makes no express reference to a right to obtain an abortion, and therefore those who claim that it protects such a right must show that the right is somehow implicit in the constitutional text.\n\u2003Roe, however, was remarkably loose in its treatment of the constitutional text. It held that the abortion right, which is not mentioned in the Constitution, is part of a right to privacy, which is also not mentioned. See 410 U. S., at 152\u2013153. And that privacy right, Roe observed, had been found to spring from no fewer than five different constitutional provisions\u2014the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Id., at 152.\n\u2003The Court\u2019s discussion left open at least three ways in which some combination of these provisions could protect the abortion right. One possibility was that the right was \u201cfounded . . . in the Ninth Amendment\u2019s reservation of rights to the people.\u201d Id., at 153. Another was that the right was rooted in the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendment, or in some combination of those provisions, and that this right had been \u201cincorporated\u201d into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment just as many other Bill of Rights provisions had by then been incorporated. Ibid; see also McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 763\u2013766 (2010)  (majority opinion) (discussing incorporation). And a third path was that the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments played no role and that the right was simply a component of the \u201cliberty\u201d protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Roe, 410 U. S., at 153.

Roe, 410 U. S., at 153. Roe expressed the \u201cfeel[ing]\u201d that the Fourteenth Amendment was the provision that did the work, but its message seemed to be that the abortion right could be found somewhere in the Constitution and that specifying its exact location was not of paramount importance.16 The Casey Court did not defend this unfocused analysis and instead grounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an abortion is part of the \u201cliberty\u201d protected by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.\n\u2003We discuss this theory in depth below, but before doing so, we briefly address one additional constitutional provision that some of respondents\u2019 amici have now offered as yet another potential home for the abortion right: the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24 (Brief for United States); see also Brief for Equal Protection Constitutional Law Scholars as Amici Curiae. Neither Roe nor Casey saw fit to invoke this theory, and it is squarely foreclosed by our precedents, which establish that a State\u2019s regulation of abortion is not a sex-based classification and is thus not subject to the \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d that applies to such classifications.17 The regulation of a medical procedure that  only one sex can undergo does not trigger heightened constitutional scrutiny unless the regulation is a \u201cmere pretex[t] designed to effect an invidious discrimination against members of one sex or the other.\u201d Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U. S. 484, 496, n. 20 (1974). And as the Court has stated, the \u201cgoal of preventing abortion\u201d does not constitute \u201cinvidiously discriminatory animus\u201d against women. Bray v. Alexandria Women\u2019s Health Clinic, 506 U. S. 263, 273\u2013274 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, laws regulating or prohibiting abortion are not subject to heightened scrutiny. Rather, they are governed by the same standard of review as other health and safety measures.18\n\u2003With this new theory addressed, we turn to Casey\u2019s bold assertion that the abortion right is an aspect of the \u201cliberty\u201d protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 505 U. S., at 846; Brief for Respondents 17; Brief for United States 21\u201322.\n2\n\u2003The underlying theory on which this argument rests\u2014that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for \u201cliberty\u201d\u2014has long been controversial. But our decisions have held that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of substantive rights.\n\u2003The first consists of rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments. Those Amendments originally applied only to the Federal Government, Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 247\u2013251 (1833) (opinion for the Court by Marshall, C. J.), but this Court has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \u201cincorporates\u201d the great majority of those rights and thus makes them equally applicable to the States. See McDonald, 561  U. S., at 763\u2013767, and nn. 12\u201313. The second category\u2014which is the one in question here\u2014comprises a select list of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution.\n\u2003In deciding whether a right falls", "doc_id": "0dea24f9-8822-48fb-bb70-51b74179d20e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6b194e13a0f2a0efd3f8262f3de0a2a8154927eb906127ab7d36712cc67e489d", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1OYyXhZ3vZt9_hN-_PLRYwAEaghAchk7S-vdoY4B_jVs"}, "node_info": {"start": 17569, "end": 21286}, "relationships": {"1": "61de6981-d5d9-46cd-b938-eadee7a82e6b", "2": "85bf1900-eade-485e-ab00-056eec93b9cc", "3": "246c8c71-aa2c-49e4-9e66-e072c7e66648"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "246c8c71-aa2c-49e4-9e66-e072c7e66648": {"__data__": {"text": "have held that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of substantive rights.\n\u2003The first consists of rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments.

The second category\u2014which is the one in question here\u2014comprises a select list of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution.\n\u2003In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the Court has long asked whether the right is \u201cdeeply rooted in [our] history and tradition\u201d and whether it is essential to our Nation\u2019s \u201cscheme of ordered liberty.\u201d Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted); McDonald, 561 U. S., at 764, 767 (internal quotation marks omitted); Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721 (internal quotation marks omitted).19 And in conducting this inquiry, we have engaged in a careful analysis of the history of the right at issue.\n\u2003Justice Ginsburg\u2019s opinion for the Court in Timbs is a recent example. In concluding that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s protection against excessive fines is \u201cfundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty\u201d and \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u201d 586 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted), her opinion traced the right back to Magna Carta, Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries, and 35 of the 37 state constitutions in effect at the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. 586 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 3\u20137).\n\u2003A similar inquiry was undertaken in McDonald, which held that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms. The lead opinion surveyed the origins of the Second Amendment, the debates in Congress about  the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the state constitutions in effect when that Amendment was ratified (at least 22 of the 37 States protected the right to keep and bear arms), federal laws enacted during the same period, and other relevant historical evidence. 561 U. S., at 767\u2013777. Only then did the opinion conclude that \u201cthe Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty.\u201d Id., at 778; see also id., at 822\u2013850 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (surveying history and reaching the same result under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Privileges or Immunities Clause).\n\u2003Timbs and McDonald concerned the question whether the Fourteenth Amendment protects rights that are expressly set out in the Bill of Rights, and it would be anomalous if similar historical support were not required when a putative right is not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. Thus, in Glucksberg, which held that the Due Process Clause does not confer a right to assisted suicide, the Court surveyed more than 700 years of \u201cAnglo-American common law tradition,\u201d 521 U.

As Lincoln once said: \u201cWe all declare for Liberty; but in using the same word we do not all mean the same thing.\u201d20 In a well-known essay, Isaiah Berlin reported that \u201c[h]istorians of ideas\u201d had cataloged more than  200 different senses in which the term had been used.21\n\u2003In interpreting what is meant by the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s reference to \u201cliberty,\u201d we must guard against the natural human tendency to confuse what that Amendment protects with our own ardent views about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. That is why the Court has long been \u201creluctant\u201d to recognize rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution. Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992). \u201cSubstantive due process has at times been a treacherous field for this Court,\u201d Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 503 (1977) (plurality opinion), and it has sometimes led the Court to usurp authority that the Constitution entrusts to the people\u2019s elected representatives. See Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 225\u2013226 (1985). As the Court cautioned in Glucksberg, \u201c[w]e must . . . exercise the utmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field, lest the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy preferences of the Members of this Court.\u201d 521 U. S., at 720 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\u2003On occasion, when the Court has ignored the \u201c[a]ppropriate limits\u201d imposed by \u201c \u2018respect for the teachings of history,\u2019 \u201d Moore, 431 U. S., at 503 (plurality opinion), it has fallen into the freewheeling judicial policymaking that characterized discredited decisions such as Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). The Court must not fall prey to such an unprincipled approach. Instead, guided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of our Nation\u2019s concept of ordered liberty, we must ask what the Fourteenth Amendment means by the term \u201cliberty.\u201d When we engage in that inquiry in the present case, the clear answer is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect the right to an abortion.22\n B\n1\n\u2003Until the latter part of the 20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. No state constitutional provision had recognized such a right. Until a few years before Roe was handed down, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor had any scholarly treatise of which we are aware. And although law review articles are not reticent about advocating new rights, the earliest article proposing a constitutional right to abortion that has come to our attention was published only a few years before Roe.23\n\u2003Not only was there no support for such a constitutional  right until shortly before Roe, but abortion had long been a crime in every single State.

At common law, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy, and the remaining States would soon follow.\n\u2003Roe either ignored or misstated this history, and Casey declined to reconsider Roe\u2019s faulty historical analysis. It is therefore important to set the record straight.\n2\na\n\u2003We begin with the common law, under which abortion was a crime at least after \u201cquickening\u201d\u2014i.e., the first felt movement of the fetus in the womb, which usually occurs between the 16th and 18th week of pregnancy.24\n\u2003The \u201ceminent common-law authorities (Blackstone, Coke, Hale, and the like),\u201d Kahler v. Kansas, 589 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 7), all describe abortion after quick ening as criminal. Henry de Bracton\u2019s 13th-century treatise explained that if a person has \u201cstruck a pregnant woman, or has given her poison, whereby he has caused abortion, if the foetus be already formed and animated, and particularly if it be animated, he commits homicide.\u201d 2 De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae 279 (T. Twiss ed. 1879); see also 1 Fleta, c. 23, reprinted in 72 Selden Soc. 60\u201361 (H. Richardson & G. Sayles eds. 1955) (13th-century treatise).25\n\u2003Sir Edward Coke\u2019s 17th-century treatise likewise asserted that abortion of a quick child was \u201cmurder\u201d if the \u201cchilde be born alive\u201d and a \u201cgreat misprision\u201d if the \u201cchilde dieth in her body.\u201d 3 Institutes of the Laws of England 50\u201351 (1644). (\u201cMisprision\u201d referred to \u201csome heynous offence under the degree of felony.\u201d Id., at 139.) Two treatises by Sir Matthew Hale likewise described abortion of a quick child who died in the womb as a \u201cgreat crime\u201d and a \u201cgreat misprision.\u201d Pleas of the Crown 53 (P. Glazebrook ed. 1972); 1 History of the Pleas of the Crown 433 (1736) (Hale). And writing near the time of the adoption of our Constitution, William Blackstone explained that abortion of a \u201cquick\u201d child was \u201cby the ancient law homicide or manslaughter\u201d (citing Bracton), and at least a very \u201cheinous misdemeanor\u201d (citing Coke). 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 129\u2013130 (7th ed. 1775) (Blackstone).\n\u2003English cases dating all the way back to the 13th century corroborate the treatises\u2019 statements that abortion was a crime.

Keown, Abortion, Doctors and the Law 3\u201312 (1988) (Keown). In 1732, for example, Eleanor Beare was convicted of \u201cdestroying the Foetus in  the Womb\u201d of another woman and \u201cthereby causing her to miscarry.\u201d26 For that crime and another \u201cmisdemeanor,\u201d Beare was sentenced to two days in the pillory and three years\u2019 imprisonment.27\n\u2003Although a pre-quickening abortion was not itself considered homicide, it does not follow that abortion was permissible at common law\u2014much less that abortion was a legal right. Cf. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 713 (removal of \u201ccommon law\u2019s harsh sanctions did not represent an acceptance of suicide\u201d). Quite to the contrary, in the 1732 case mentioned above, the judge said of the charge of abortion (with no mention of quickening) that he had \u201cnever met with a case so barbarous and unnatural.\u201d28 Similarly, an indictment from 1602, which did not distinguish between a pre-quickening and post-quickening abortion, described abortion as \u201cpernicious\u201d and \u201cagainst the peace of our Lady the Queen, her crown and dignity.\u201d Keown 7 (discussing R. v. Webb, Calendar of Assize Records, Surrey Indictments 512 (1980)).\n\u2003That the common law did not condone even pre- quickening abortions is confirmed by what one might call a proto-felony-murder rule. Hale and Blackstone explained a way in which a pre-quickening abortion could rise to the level of a homicide. Hale wrote that if a physician gave a woman \u201cwith child\u201d a \u201cpotion\u201d to cause an abortion, and the woman died, it was \u201cmurder\u201d because the potion was given \u201cunlawfully to destroy her child within her.\u201d 1 Hale 429\u2013430 (emphasis added). As Blackstone explained, to be \u201cmurder\u201d a killing had to be done with \u201cmalice aforethought, . . . either express or implied.\u201d 4 Blackstone 198 (emphasis deleted). In the case of an abortionist, Black stone wrote, \u201cthe law will imply [malice]\u201d for the same reason that it would imply malice if a person who intended to kill one person accidentally killed a different person:\n\u201c[I]f one shoots at A and misses him, but kills B, this is murder; because of the previous felonious intent, which the law transfers from one to the other. The same is the case, where one lays poison for A; and B, against whom the prisoner had no malicious intent, takes it, and it kills him; this is likewise murder. So also, if one gives a woman with child a medicine to procure abortion, and it operates so violently as to kill the woman, this is murder in the person who gave it.\u201d Id., at 200\u2013201 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).29\n\u2003Notably, Blackstone, like Hale, did not state that this proto-felony-murder rule required that the woman be \u201cwith quick", "doc_id": "83471972-edb2-4817-b12a-3c2500368eea", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "15ab5ea0c1d69f89eb26ed515a16320c4c71561bb14728c80429de180b5d5839", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1OYyXhZ3vZt9_hN-_PLRYwAEaghAchk7S-vdoY4B_jVs"}, "node_info": {"start": 32090, "end": 35410}, "relationships": {"1": "61de6981-d5d9-46cd-b938-eadee7a82e6b", "2": "928411c7-b7ba-4c1e-9877-291a16869ba4", "3": "4de3fea2-5cf8-47b1-9bc8-70b880c03025"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4de3fea2-5cf8-47b1-9bc8-70b880c03025": {"__data__": {"text": "different person:\n\u201c[I]f one shoots at A and misses him, but kills B, this is murder; because of the previous felonious intent, which the law transfers from one to the other.

And it is revealing that Hale and Blackstone treated abortionists differently from other physicians or surgeons who caused the death of a patient \u201cwithout any intent of doing [the patient] any bodily hurt.\u201d Hale 429; see 4 Blackstone 197. These other physicians\u2014even if \u201cunlicensed\u201d\u2014would not be \u201cguilty of murder or manslaughter.\u201d Hale 429. But a physician performing an abortion would, precisely because his aim was an \u201cunlawful\u201d one.\n\u2003In sum, although common-law authorities differed on the severity of punishment for abortions committed at different points in pregnancy, none endorsed the practice. Moreover, we are aware of no common-law case or authority, and the parties have not pointed to any, that remotely suggests a  positive right to procure an abortion at any stage of pregnancy.\nb\n\u2003In this country, the historical record is similar. The \u201cmost important early American edition of Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries,\u201d District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U. S. 570, 594 (2008), reported Blackstone\u2019s statement that abortion of a quick child was at least \u201ca heinous misdemeanor,\u201d 2 St. George Tucker, Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries 129\u2013130 (1803), and that edition also included Blackstone\u2019s discussion of the proto-felony-murder rule, 5 id., at 200\u2013201. Manuals for justices of the peace printed in the Colonies in the 18th century typically restated the common-law rule on abortion, and some manuals repeated Hale\u2019s and Blackstone\u2019s statements that anyone who prescribed medication \u201cunlawfully to destroy the child\u201d would be guilty of murder if the woman died. See, e.g., J. Parker, Conductor Generalis 220 (1788); 2 R. Burn, Justice of the Peace, and Parish Officer 221\u2013222 (7th ed. 1762) (English manual stating the same).30\n\u2003The few cases available from the early colonial period cor roborate that abortion was a crime. See generally Dellapenna 215\u2013228 (collecting cases). In Maryland in 1652, for example, an indictment charged that a man \u201cMurtherously endeavoured to destroy or Murther the Child by him begotten in the Womb.\u201d Proprietary v. Mitchell, 10 Md. Archives 80, 183 (1652) (W. Browne ed. 1891). And by the 19th century, courts frequently explained that the common law made abortion of a quick child a crime. See, e.g., Smith v. Gaffard, 31 Ala. 45, 51 (1857); Smith v. State, 33 Me. 48, 55 (1851); State v. Cooper, 22 N. J. L. 52, 52\u201355 (1849); Commonwealth v. Parker, 50 Mass. 263, 264\u2013268 (1845).\nc\n\u2003The original ground for drawing a distinction between pre- and post-quickening abortions is not entirely clear, but some have attributed the rule to the difficulty of proving that a pre-quickening fetus was alive.

At that time, there were no scientific methods for detecting pregnancy in its early stages,31 and thus, as one court put it in 1872: \u201c[U]ntil the period of quickening there is no evidence of life; and whatever may be said of the feotus, the law has fixed upon this period of gestation as the time when the child is endowed with life\u201d because \u201cfoetal movements are the first clearly marked and well defined evidences of life.\u201d Evans v. People, 49 N. Y. 86, 90 (emphasis added); Cooper, 22 N. J. L., at 56 (\u201cIn contemplation of law life commences at the moment of quickening, at that moment when the embryo gives the first physical proof of life, no matter when it first received it\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\u2003The Solicitor General offers a different explanation of the  basis for the quickening rule, namely, that before quickening the common law did not regard a fetus \u201cas having a \u2018separate and independent existence.\u2019 \u201d Brief for United States 26 (quoting Parker, 50 Mass., at 266). But the case on which the Solicitor General relies for this proposition also suggested that the criminal law\u2019s quickening rule was out of step with the treatment of prenatal life in other areas of law, noting that \u201cto many purposes, in reference to civil rights, an infant in ventre sa mere is regarded as a person in being.\u201d Ibid. (citing 1 Blackstone 129); see also Evans, 49 N. Y., at 89; Mills v. Commonwealth, 13 Pa. 631, 633 (1850); Morrow v. Scott, 7 Ga. 535, 537 (1849); Hall v.

Rep. 117, 163 (1789).\n\u2003At any rate, the original ground for the quickening rule is of little importance for present purposes because the rule was abandoned in the 19th century. During that period, treatise writers and commentators criticized the quickening distinction as \u201cneither in accordance with the result of medical experience, nor with the principles of the common law.\u201d F. Wharton, Criminal Law \u00a71220, p. 606 (rev. 4th ed. 1857) (footnotes omitted); see also J. Beck, Researches in Medicine and Medical Jurisprudence 26\u201328 (2d ed. 1835) (describing the quickening distinction as \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cinjurious\u201d).32 In 1803, the British Parliament made abortion  a crime at all stages of pregnancy and authorized the imposition of severe punishment. See Lord Ellenborough\u2019s Act, 43 Geo. 3, c. 58 (1803).

See Appendix A, infra (listing state statutory provisions in chronological order).33 By 1868, the year when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, three-quarters of the States, 28 out of 37, had enacted statutes making abortion a crime even if it was performed before quickening.34 See ibid. Of the nine States that had not yet criminalized abortion at all stages, all but one did so by 1910. See ibid.\n\u2003The trend in the Territories that would become the last 13 States was similar: All of them criminalized abortion at  all stages of pregnancy between 1850 (the Kingdom of Hawaii) and 1919 (New Mexico). See Appendix B, infra; see also Casey, 505 U. S., at 952 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Dellapenna 317\u2013319. By the end of the 1950s, according to the Roe Court\u2019s own count, statutes in all but four States and the District of Columbia prohibited abortion \u201chowever and whenever performed, unless done to save or preserve the life of the mother.\u201d 410 U. S., at 139.35\n\u2003This overwhelming consensus endured until the day Roe was decided. At that time, also by the Roe Court\u2019s own count, a substantial majority\u201430 States\u2014still prohibited abortion at all stages except to save the life of the mother. See id., at 118, and n. 2 (listing States). And though Roe discerned a \u201ctrend toward liberalization\u201d in about \u201cone-third of the States,\u201d those States still criminalized some abortions and regulated them more stringently than Roe would allow. Id., at 140, and n. 37; Tribe 2. In short, the \u201cCourt\u2019s opinion in Roe itself convincingly refutes the notion that the abortion liberty is deeply rooted in the history or tradition of our people.\u201d Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 793 (1986)  (White, J., dissenting).\nd\n\u2003The inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation\u2019s history and traditions. On the contrary, an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973. The Court in Roe could have said of abortion exactly what Glucksberg said of assisted suicide: \u201cAttitudes toward [abortion] have changed since Bracton, but our laws have consistently condemned, and continue to prohibit, [that practice].\u201d 521 U.

Instead, respondents are forced to argue that it \u201cdoes [not] matter that some States prohibited abortion at the time Roe was decided or when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted.\u201d Brief for Respondents 21. But that argument flies in the face of the standard we have applied in determining whether an asserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is nevertheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\u2003Not only are respondents and their amici unable to show that a constitutional right to abortion was established when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, but they have found no support for the existence of an abortion right that  predates the latter part of the 20th century\u2014no state constitutional provision, no statute, no judicial decision, no learned treatise. The earliest sources called to our attention are a few district court and state court decisions decided shortly before Roe and a small number of law review articles from the same time period.36\n\u2003A few of respondents\u2019 amici muster historical arguments, but they are very weak. The Solicitor General repeats Roe\u2019s claim that it is \u201c \u2018doubtful\u2019 . . . \u2018abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus.\u2019 \u201d Brief for United States 26 (quoting Roe, 410 U. S., at 136). But as we have seen, great common-law authorities like Bracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstone all wrote that a post-quickening abortion was a crime\u2014and a serious one at that. Moreover, Hale and Blackstone (and many other authorities following them) asserted that even a pre-quickening abortion was \u201cunlawful\u201d and that, as a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from the attempt.\n\u2003Instead of following these authorities, Roe relied largely on two articles by a pro-abortion advocate who claimed that Coke had intentionally misstated the common law because of his strong anti-abortion views.37 These articles have been discredited,38 and it has come to light that even members of Jane Roe\u2019s legal team did not regard them as serious  scholarship. An internal memorandum characterized this author\u2019s work as donning \u201cthe guise of impartial scholarship while advancing the proper ideological goals.\u201d39 Continued reliance on such scholarship is unsupportable.\n\u2003The Solicitor General next suggests that history supports an abortion right because the common law\u2019s failure to criminalize abortion before quickening means that \u201cat the Founding and for decades thereafter, women generally could terminate a pregnancy, at least in its early stages.\u201d40 Brief for United States 26\u201327; see also Brief for Respondents 21. But the insistence on quickening was not universal, see Mills, 13 Pa., at 633; State v. Slagle, 83 N. C. 630, 632 (1880), and regardless, the fact that many States in the late 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-quickening abortions does not mean that anyone thought the States lacked the authority to do so.

When legislatures began to exercise that authority as the century wore on, no  one, as far as we are aware, argued that the laws they enacted violated a fundamental right. That is not surprising since common-law authorities had repeatedly condemned abortion and described it as an \u201cunlawful\u201d act without regard to whether it occurred before or after quickening. See supra, at 16\u201321.\n\u2003Another amicus brief relied upon by respondents (see Brief for Respondents 21) tries to dismiss the significance of the state criminal statutes that were in effect when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted by suggesting that they were enacted for illegitimate reasons. According to this account, which is based almost entirely on statements made by one prominent proponent of the statutes, important motives for the laws were the fear that Catholic immigrants were having more babies than Protestants and that the availability of abortion was leading White Protestant women to \u201cshir[k their] maternal duties.\u201d Brief for American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 20.\n\u2003Resort to this argument is a testament to the lack of any real historical support for the right that Roe and Casey recognized. This Court has long disfavored arguments based on alleged legislative motives. See, e.g., Erie v. Pap\u2019s A. M., 529 U. S. 277, 292 (2000) (plurality opinion); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 652 (1994); United States v. O\u2019Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 383 (1968); Arizona v. California, 283 U. S. 423, 455 (1931) (collecting cases). The Court has recognized that inquiries into legislative motives \u201care a hazardous matter.\u201d O\u2019Brien, 391 U. S., at 383. Even when an argument about legislative motive is backed by statements made by legislators who voted for a law, we have been reluctant to attribute those motives to the legislative body as a whole. \u201cWhat motivates one legislator to make a speech about a statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it.\u201d Id., at 384.\n\u2003Here, the argument about legislative motive is not even  based on statements by legislators, but on statements made by a few supporters of the new 19th-century abortion laws, and it is quite a leap to attribute these motives to all the legislators whose votes were responsible for the enactment of those laws. Recall that at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, over three-quarters of the States had adopted statutes criminalizing abortion (usually at all stages of pregnancy), and that from the early 20th century until the day Roe was handed down, every single State had such a law on its books. Are we to believe that the hundreds of lawmakers whose votes were needed to enact these laws were motivated by hostility to Catholics and women?\n\u2003There is ample evidence that the passage of these laws was instead spurred by a sincere belief that abortion kills a human being. Many judicial decisions from the late 19th and early 20th centuries made that point. See, e.g., Nash v.

Slatery, 14 F. 4th 409, 446, and n. 11 (CA6 2021) (Thapar, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (citing cases).\n\u2003One may disagree with this belief (and our decision is not based on any view about when a State should regard prenatal life as having rights or legally cognizable interests), but even Roe and Casey did not question the good faith of abortion opponents. See, e.g., Casey, 505 U. S., at 850 (\u201cMen and women of good conscience can disagree . . . about the profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy even in its earliest stage\u201d). And we see no  reason to discount the significance of the state laws in question based on these amici\u2019s suggestions about legislative motive.41\nC\n1\n\u2003Instead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right itself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Casey contend that the abortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right. Roe termed this a right to privacy, 410 U. S., at 154, and Casey described it as the freedom to make \u201cintimate and personal choices\u201d that are \u201ccentral to personal dignity and autonomy,\u201d 505 U. S., at 851. Casey elaborated: \u201cAt the heart of liberty is the right to define one\u2019s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\u201d Ibid.\n\u2003The Court did not claim that this broadly framed right is absolute, and no such claim would be plausible. While individuals are certainly free to think and to say what they wish about \u201cexistence,\u201d \u201cmeaning,\u201d the \u201cuniverse,\u201d and \u201cthe mystery of human life,\u201d they are not always free to act in accordance with those thoughts.

In some States, voters may believe that the abortion right should be even more extensive than the right that Roe and Casey recognized. Voters in other States may wish to impose tight restrictions based on their belief that abortion destroys an \u201cunborn human being.\u201d Miss. Code Ann. \u00a741\u201341\u2013191(4)(b). Our Nation\u2019s historical understanding of ordered liberty does not prevent the people\u2019s elected representatives from deciding how abortion should be regulated.\n\u2003Nor does the right to obtain an abortion have a sound basis in precedent. Casey relied on cases involving the right to marry a person of a different race, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); the right to marry while in prison, Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987); the right to obtain contraceptives, Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965), Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972), Carey v. Population Services Int\u2019l, 431 U. S. 678 (1977); the right to reside with relatives, Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977); the right to make decisions about the education of one\u2019s children, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 (1925), Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 (1923); the right not to be sterilized without consent, Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942); and the right in certain circumstances not to undergo involuntary surgery, forced administration of drugs, or other substantially similar procedures, Winston v. Lee, 470 U. S. 753 (1985), Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210 (1990), Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952). Respondents and the Solicitor General  also rely on post-Casey decisions like Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003) (right to engage in private, consensual sexual acts), and Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015) (right to marry a person of the same sex). See Brief for Respondents 18; Brief for United States 23\u201324.\n\u2003These attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one\u2019s \u201cconcept of existence\u201d prove too much. Casey, 505 U. S., at 851. Those criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like. See Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 85 F. 3d 1440, 1444 (CA9 1996) (O\u2019Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). None of these rights has any claim to being deeply rooted in history.

Id., at 1440, 1445.\n\u2003What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions call \u201cpotential life\u201d and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an \u201cunborn human being.\u201d See Roe, 410 U. S., at 159 (abortion is \u201cinherently different\u201d); Casey, 505 U. S., at 852 (abortion is \u201ca unique act\u201d). None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. They are therefore inapposite. They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way.\n2\n\u2003In drawing this critical distinction between the abortion right and other rights, it is not necessary to dispute Casey\u2019s claim (which we accept for the sake of argument) that \u201cthe specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d do not \u201cmar[k] the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth  Amendment protects.\u201d 505 U. S., at 848. Abortion is nothing new. It has been addressed by lawmakers for centuries, and the fundamental moral question that it poses is ageless.\n\u2003Defenders of Roe and Casey do not claim that any new scientific learning calls for a different answer to the underlying moral question, but they do contend that changes in society require the recognition of a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Without the availability of abortion, they maintain, people will be inhibited from exercising their freedom to choose the types of relationships they desire, and women will be unable to compete with men in the workplace and in other endeavors.\n\u2003Americans who believe that abortion should be restricted press countervailing arguments about modern developments. They note that attitudes about the pregnancy of unmarried women have changed drastically; that federal and state laws ban discrimination on the basis of pregnancy;42 that leave for pregnancy and childbirth are now guaranteed by law in many cases;43 that the costs of medical care associated with pregnancy are covered by insurance or government assistance;44 that States have increasingly adopted  \u201csafe haven\u201d laws, which generally allow women to drop off babies anonymously;45 and that a woman who puts her newborn up for adoption today has little reason to fear that the baby will not find a suitable home.46 They also claim that many people now have a new appreciation of fetal life and that when prospective parents who want to have a child view a sonogram, they typically have no doubt that what they see is their daughter or son.\n\u2003Both sides make important policy arguments, but supporters of Roe and Casey must show that this Court has the authority to weigh those arguments and decide how abortion may be regulated in the States.

The dissent does not identify any pre-Roe authority that supports such a right\u2014no state constitutional provision or statute, no federal or state judicial precedent, not even a scholarly treatise. Compare post, at 12\u201314, n. 2, with supra, at 15\u201316, and n. 23. Nor does the dissent dispute the fact that abortion was illegal at common law at least after quickening; that the 19th century saw a trend toward criminalization of pre-quickening abortions; that by 1868, a supermajority of States (at least 26 of 37) had enacted statutes criminalizing abortion at all stages of pregnancy; that by the late 1950s at least 46 States prohibited abortion \u201chowever and whenever performed\u201d except if necessary to save \u201cthe life of the mother,\u201d Roe, 410 U.

Compare post, at 12\u201314, nn. 2\u20133, with supra, at 23\u201325, and nn. 33\u201334.47\n\u2003The dissent\u2019s failure to engage with this long tradition is devastating to its position. We have held that the \u201cestablished method of substantive-due-process analysis\u201d requires that an unenumerated right be \u201c \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u2019 \u201d before it can be recognized as a component of the \u201cliberty\u201d protected in the Due Process Clause. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721; cf. Timbs, 586 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). But despite the dissent\u2019s  professed fidelity to stare decisis, it fails to seriously engage with that important precedent\u2014which it cannot possibly satisfy.\n\u2003The dissent attempts to obscure this failure by misrepresenting our application of Glucksberg. The dissent suggests that we have focused only on \u201cthe legal status of abortion in the 19th century,\u201d post, at 26, but our review of this Nation\u2019s tradition extends well past that period. As explained, for more than a century after 1868\u2014including \u201canother half-century\u201d after women gained the constitutional right to vote in 1920, see post, at 15; Amdt. 19\u2014it was firmly established that laws prohibiting abortion like the Texas law at issue in Roe were permissible exercises of state regulatory authority. And today, another half century later, more than half of the States have asked us to overrule Roe and Casey.

The dissent cannot establish that a right to abortion has ever been part of this Nation\u2019s tradition.\n2\n\u2003Because the dissent cannot argue that the abortion right is rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition, it contends that the \u201cconstitutional tradition\u201d is \u201cnot captured whole at a single moment,\u201d and that its \u201cmeaning gains content from the long sweep of our history and from successive judicial precedents.\u201d Post, at 18 (internal quotation marks omitted). This vague formulation imposes no clear restraints on what Justice White called the \u201cexercise of raw judicial power,\u201d Roe, 410 U. S., at 222 (dissenting opinion), and while the dissent claims that its standard \u201cdoes not mean anything goes,\u201d post, at 17, any real restraints are hard to discern.\n\u2003The largely limitless reach of the dissenters\u2019 standard is illustrated by the way they apply it here. First, if the \u201clong sweep of history\u201d imposes any restraint on the recognition of unenumerated rights, then Roe was surely wrong, since abortion was never allowed (except to save the life of the  mother) in a majority of States for over 100 years before that decision was handed down. Second, it is impossible to defend Roe based on prior precedent because all of the precedents Roe cited, including Griswold and Eisenstadt, were critically different for a reason that we have explained: None of those cases involved the destruction of what Roe called \u201cpotential life.\u201d See supra, at 32.\n\u2003So without support in history or relevant precedent, Roe\u2019s reasoning cannot be defended even under the dissent\u2019s proposed test, and the dissent is forced to rely solely on the fact that a constitutional right to abortion was recognized in Roe and later decisions that accepted Roe\u2019s interpretation. Under the doctrine of stare decisis, those precedents are entitled to careful and respectful consideration, and we engage in that analysis below. But as the Court has reiterated time and time again, adherence to precedent is not \u201c \u2018an inexorable command.\u2019 \u201d Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 455 (2015). There are occasions when past decisions should be overruled, and as we will explain, this is one of them.\n3\n\u2003The most striking feature of the dissent is the absence of any serious discussion of the legitimacy of the States\u2019 interest in protecting fetal life. This is evident in the analogy that the dissent draws between the abortion right and the rights recognized in Griswold (contraception), Eisenstadt (same), Lawrence (sexual conduct with member of the same sex), and Obergefell (same-sex marriage). Perhaps this is designed to stoke unfounded fear that our decision will imperil those other rights, but the dissent\u2019s analogy is objectionable for a more important reason: what it reveals about the dissent\u2019s views on the protection of what Roe called \u201cpotential life.\u201d The exercise of the rights at issue in Griswold, Eisenstadt, Lawrence, and Obergefell does not destroy a \u201cpotential life,\u201d but an abortion has that effect. So if the rights  at issue in those cases are fundamentally the same as the right recognized in Roe and Casey, the implication is clear: The Constitution does not permit the States to regard the destruction of a \u201cpotential life\u201d as a matter of any significance.\n\u2003That view is evident throughout the dissent.

So if the rights  at issue in those cases are fundamentally the same as the right recognized in Roe and Casey, the implication is clear: The Constitution does not permit the States to regard the destruction of a \u201cpotential life\u201d as a matter of any significance.\n\u2003That view is evident throughout the dissent. The dissent has much to say about the effects of pregnancy on women, the burdens of motherhood, and the difficulties faced by poor women. These are important concerns. However, the dissent evinces no similar regard for a State\u2019s interest in protecting prenatal life. The dissent repeatedly praises the \u201cbalance,\u201d post, at 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, that the viability line strikes between a woman\u2019s liberty interest and the State\u2019s interest in prenatal life. But for reasons we discuss later, see infra, at 50\u201354, 55\u201356, and given in the opinion of The Chief Justice, post, at 2\u20135 (opinion concurring in judgment), the viability line makes no sense. It was not adequately justified in Roe, and the dissent does not even try to defend it today. Nor does it identify any other point in a pregnancy after which a State is permitted to prohibit the destruction of a fetus.\n\u2003Our opinion is not based on any view about if and when prenatal life is entitled to any of the rights enjoyed after birth. The dissent, by contrast, would impose on the people a particular theory about when the rights of personhood begin. According to the dissent, the Constitution requires the States to regard a fetus as lacking even the most basic human right\u2014to live\u2014at least until an arbitrary point in a pregnancy has passed. Nothing in the Constitution or in our Nation\u2019s legal traditions authorizes the Court to adopt that \u201c \u2018theory of life.\u2019 \u201d Post, at 8.\nIII\n\u2003We next consider whether the doctrine of stare decisis counsels continued acceptance of Roe and Casey. Stare decisis plays an important role in our case law, and we have  explained that it serves many valuable ends. It protects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a past decision. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 856 (joint opinion); see also Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991). It \u201creduces incentives for challenging settled precedents, saving parties and courts the expense of endless relitigation.\u201d Kimble, 576 U. S., at 455. It fosters \u201cevenhanded\u201d decisionmaking by requiring that like cases be decided in a like manner. Payne, 501 U. S., at 827. It \u201ccontributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.\u201d Ibid. And it restrains judicial hubris and reminds us to respect the judgment of those who have grappled with important questions in the past. \u201cPrecedent is a way of accumulating and passing down the learning of past generations, a font of established wisdom richer than what can be found in any single judge or panel of judges.\u201d N. Gorsuch, A Republic, If You Can Keep It 217 (2019).\n\u2003We have long recognized, however, that stare decisis is \u201cnot an inexorable command,\u201d Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.

It has been said that it is sometimes more important that an issue \u201c \u2018be settled than that it be settled right.\u2019 \u201d Kimble, 576 U. S., at 455 (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)). But when it comes to the interpretation of the Constitution\u2014the \u201cgreat charter of our liberties,\u201d which was meant \u201cto endure through a long lapse of ages,\u201d Martin v. Hunter\u2019s Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 326 (1816) (opinion for the Court by Story, J.)\u2014we place a high value on having the matter \u201csettled right.\u201d In addition, when one of our constitutional decisions goes astray, the country is usually stuck with the bad decision unless we correct our own mistake. An erroneous constitutional decision can be fixed by amending the Constitution, but our Constitution is notoriously hard to  amend. See Art. V; Kimble, 576 U. S., at 456. Therefore, in appropriate circumstances we must be willing to reconsider and, if necessary, overrule constitutional decisions.\n\u2003Some of our most important constitutional decisions have overruled prior precedents. We mention three. In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), the Court repudiated the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine, which had allowed States to maintain racially segregated schools and other facilities. Id., at 488 (internal quotation marks omitted). In so doing, the Court overruled the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), along with six other Supreme Court precedents that had applied the  separate-but-equal rule. See Brown, 347 U. S., at 491.\n\u2003In West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937), the Court overruled Adkins v. Children\u2019s Hospital of D. C., 261 U. S. 525 (1923), which had held that a law setting minimum wages for women violated the \u201cliberty\u201d protected by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Id., at 545. West Coast Hotel signaled the demise of an entire line of important precedents that had protected an individual liberty right against state and federal health and welfare legislation. See Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905) (holding invalid a law setting maximum working hours); Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U. S. 1 (1915) (holding invalid a law banning contracts forbidding employees to join a union); Jay Burns Baking Co. v. Bryan, 264 U. S. 504 (1924) (holding invalid laws fixing the weight of loaves of bread).\n\u2003Finally, in West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.

S. 586 (1940), and held that public school students could not be compelled to salute the flag in violation of their sincere beliefs. Barnette stands out because nothing had changed during the intervening period other than the Court\u2019s belated recognition that its earlier decision had been seriously wrong.\n \u2003On many other occasions, this Court has overruled important constitutional decisions. (We include a partial list in the footnote that follows.48) Without these decisions,  American constitutional law as we know it would be unrecognizable, and this would be a different country.\n\u2003No Justice of this Court has ever argued that the Court should never overrule a constitutional decision, but overruling a precedent is a serious matter. It is not a step that should be taken lightly. Our cases have attempted to provide a framework for deciding when a precedent should be overruled, and they have identified factors that should be considered in making such a decision. Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees, 585 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2018) (slip op., at 34\u201335); Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___\u2013___ (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in part) (slip op., at 7\u20139).\n\u2003In this case, five factors weigh strongly in favor of overruling Roe and Casey: the nature of their error, the quality of their reasoning, the \u201cworkability\u201d of the rules they imposed on the country, their disruptive effect on other areas of the law, and the absence of concrete reliance.\nA\n\u2003The nature of the Court\u2019s error. An erroneous interpretation of the Constitution is always important, but some are more damaging than others.\n\u2003The infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, was one such decision. It betrayed our commitment to \u201cequality before the law.\u201d 163 U. S., at 562 (Harlan, J., dissenting). It was \u201cegregiously wrong\u201d on the day it was decided, see Ramos, 590 U. S., at ___ (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.) (slip op., at 7), and as the Solicitor General agreed at oral argument, it should have been overruled at the earliest opportunity, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 92\u201393.\n\u2003Roe was also egregiously wrong and deeply damaging. For reasons already explained, Roe\u2019s constitutional analysis was far outside the bounds of any reasonable interpretation  of the various constitutional provisions to which it vaguely pointed.\n\u2003Roe was on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided, Casey perpetuated its errors, and those errors do not concern some arcane corner of the law of little importance to the American people. Rather, wielding nothing but \u201craw judicial power,\u201d Roe, 410 U. S., at 222 (White, J., dissenting), the Court usurped the power to address a question of profound moral and social importance that the Constitution unequivocally leaves for the people.

Rather, wielding nothing but \u201craw judicial power,\u201d Roe, 410 U. S., at 222 (White, J., dissenting), the Court usurped the power to address a question of profound moral and social importance that the Constitution unequivocally leaves for the people. Casey described itself as calling both sides of the national controversy to resolve their debate, but in doing so, Casey necessarily declared a winning side. Those on the losing side\u2014those who sought to advance the State\u2019s interest in fetal life\u2014could no longer seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views. The Court short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who dissented in any respect from Roe. \u201cRoe fanned into life an issue that has inflamed our national politics in general, and has obscured with its smoke the selection of Justices to this Court in particular, ever since.\u201d Casey, 505 U. S., at 995\u2013996 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Together, Roe and Casey represent an error that cannot be allowed to stand.\n\u2003As the Court\u2019s landmark decision in West Coast Hotel illustrates, the Court has previously overruled decisions that wrongly removed an issue from the people and the democratic process. As Justice White later explained, \u201cdecisions that find in the Constitution principles or values that cannot fairly be read into that document usurp the people\u2019s authority, for such decisions represent choices that the people have never made and that they cannot disavow through corrective legislation. For this reason, it is essential that this Court maintain the power to restore authority to its proper possessors by correcting constitutional decisions that, on reconsideration, are found to be mistaken.\u201d Thornburgh, 476  U. S., at 787 (dissenting opinion).\nB\n\u2003The quality of the reasoning. Under our precedents, the quality of the reasoning in a prior case has an important bearing on whether it should be reconsidered. See Janus, 585 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 38); Ramos, 590 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.) (slip op., at 7\u20138). In Part II, supra, we explained why Roe was incorrectly decided, but that decision was more than just wrong. It stood on exceptionally weak grounds.\n\u2003Roe found that the Constitution implicitly conferred a right to obtain an abortion, but it failed to ground its decision in text, history, or precedent. It relied on an erroneous historical narrative; it devoted great attention to and presumably relied on matters that have no bearing on the meaning of the Constitution; it disregarded the fundamental difference between the precedents on which it relied and the question before the Court; it concocted an elaborate set of rules, with different restrictions for each trimester of pregnancy, but it did not explain how this veritable code could be teased out of anything in the Constitution, the history of abortion laws, prior precedent, or any other cited source; and its most important rule (that States cannot protect fetal life prior to \u201cviability\u201d) was never raised by any party and has never been plausibly explained. Roe\u2019s reasoning quickly drew scathing scholarly criticism, even from supporters of broad access to abortion.\n\u2003The Casey plurality, while reaffirming Roe\u2019s central holding, pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its reasoning.

It revised the textual basis for the abortion right, silently abandoned Roe\u2019s erroneous historical narrative, and jettisoned the trimester framework. But it replaced that scheme with an arbitrary \u201cundue burden\u201d test and relied on an exceptional version of stare decisis that, as explained be low, this Court had never before applied and has never invoked since.\n1\na\n\u2003The weaknesses in Roe\u2019s reasoning are well-known. Without any grounding in the constitutional text, history, or precedent, it imposed on the entire country a detailed set of rules much like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation. See 410 U. S., at 163\u2013164. Dividing pregnancy into three trimesters, the Court imposed special rules for each. During the first trimester, the Court announced, \u201cthe abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman\u2019s attending physician.\u201d Id., at 164. After that point, a State\u2019s interest in regulating abortion for the sake of a woman\u2019s health became compelling, and accordingly, a State could \u201cregulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.\u201d Ibid. Finally, in \u201cthe stage subsequent to viability,\u201d which in 1973 roughly coincided with the beginning of the third trimester, the State\u2019s interest in \u201cthe potentiality of human life\u201d became compelling, and therefore a State could \u201cregulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\u201d Id., at 164\u2013165.\n\u2003This elaborate scheme was the Court\u2019s own brainchild. Neither party advocated the trimester framework; nor did either party or any amicus argue that \u201cviability\u201d should mark the point at which the scope of the abortion right and a State\u2019s regulatory authority should be substantially transformed.

It allowed that States had tightened their abortion laws \u201cin the middle and late 19th century,\u201d id., at 139, but it implied that these laws might have been enacted not to protect fetal life but to further \u201ca Victorian social concern\u201d about \u201cillicit sexual conduct,\u201d id., at 148.\n\u2003Roe\u2019s failure even to note the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said about the common law was simply wrong. Relying on two discredited articles by an abortion advocate, the Court erroneously suggested\u2014contrary to Bracton, Coke, Hale, Blackstone, and a wealth of other authority\u2014that the common law had probably never really treated post-quickening  abortion as a crime. See id., at 136 (\u201c[I]t now appear[s] doubtful that abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus\u201d). This erroneous understanding appears to have played an important part in the Court\u2019s thinking because the opinion cited \u201cthe lenity of the common law\u201d as one of the four factors that informed its decision. Id., at 165.\n\u2003After surveying history, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee. This included a lengthy account of the \u201cposition of the American Medical Association\u201d and \u201c[t]he position of the American Public Health Association,\u201d as well as the vote by the American Bar Association\u2019s House of Delegates in February 1972 on proposed abortion legislation. Id., at 141, 144, 146 (emphasis deleted). Also noted were a British judicial decision handed down in 1939 and a new British abortion law enacted in 1967. Id., at 137\u2013138. The Court did not explain why these sources shed light on the meaning of the Constitution, and not one of them adopted or advocated anything like the scheme that Roe imposed on the country.\n\u2003Finally, after all this, the Court turned to precedent. Citing a broad array of cases, the Court found support for a constitutional \u201cright of personal privacy,\u201d id., at 152, but it conflated two very different meanings of the term: the right to shield information from disclosure and the right to make and implement important personal decisions without governmental interference. See Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599\u2013600 (1977). Only the cases involving this second sense of the term could have any possible relevance to the abortion issue, and some of the cases in that category involved personal decisions that were obviously very, very far afield.

But none of these decisions involved what is distinctive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed \u201cpotential life.\u201d\n\u2003When the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on the country, it asserted that its rules were \u201cconsistent with\u201d the following: (1) \u201cthe relative weights of the respective interests involved,\u201d (2) \u201cthe lessons and examples of medical and legal history,\u201d (3) \u201cthe lenity of the common law,\u201d and (4) \u201cthe demands of the profound problems of the present day.\u201d Roe, 410 U. S., at 165. Put aside the second and third factors, which were based on the Court\u2019s flawed account of history, and what remains are precisely the sort of considerations that legislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that accommodate competing interests. The scheme Roe produced looked like legislation, and the Court provided the sort of explanation that might be expected from a legislative body.\nc\n\u2003What Roe did not provide was any cogent justification for the lines it drew. Why, for example, does a State have no authority to regulate first trimester abortions for the purpose of protecting a woman\u2019s health? The Court\u2019s only explanation was that mortality rates for abortion at that stage were lower than the mortality rates for childbirth. Id., at 163. But the Court did not explain why mortality rates were the only factor that a State could legitimately consider. Many health and safety regulations aim to avoid adverse health consequences short of death. And the Court did not explain why it departed from the normal rule that courts defer to the judgments of legislatures \u201cin areas  fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties.\u201d Marshall v. United States, 414 U. S. 417, 427 (1974).\n\u2003An even more glaring deficiency was Roe\u2019s failure to justify the critical distinction it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions. Here is the Court\u2019s entire explanation:\n\u2003\u201cWith respect to the State\u2019s important and legitimate interest in potential life, the \u2018compelling\u2019 point is at viability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the womb.\u201d 410 U. S., at 163.\nAs Professor Laurence Tribe has written, \u201c[c]learly, this mistakes \u2018a definition for a syllogism.\u2019 \u201d Tribe 4 (quoting Ely 924). The definition of a \u201cviable\u201d fetus is one that is capable of surviving outside the womb, but why is this the point at which the State\u2019s interest becomes compelling? If, as Roe held, a State\u2019s interest in protecting prenatal life is compelling \u201cafter viability,\u201d 410 U. S., at 163, why isn\u2019t that interest \u201cequally compelling before viability\u201d? Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 519 (1989) (plurality opinion) (quoting Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 795 (White, J., dissenting)).

Roe did not say, and no explanation is apparent.\n\u2003This arbitrary line has not found much support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted to justify a right to abortion. Some have argued that a fetus should not be entitled to legal protection until it acquires the characteristics that they regard as defining what it means to be a \u201cperson.\u201d Among the characteristics that have been offered as essential attributes of \u201cpersonhood\u201d are sentience, self-awareness, the ability to reason, or some combination thereof.50 By this logic, it would be an open question  whether even born individuals, including young children or those afflicted with certain developmental or medical conditions, merit protection as \u201cpersons.\u201d But even if one takes the view that \u201cpersonhood\u201d begins when a certain attribute or combination of attributes is acquired, it is very hard to see why viability should mark the point where \u201cpersonhood\u201d begins.\n\u2003The most obvious problem with any such argument is that viability is heavily dependent on factors that have nothing to do with the characteristics of a fetus. One is the state of neonatal care at a particular point in time. Due to the development of new equipment and improved practices, the viability line has changed over the years. In the 19th century, a fetus may not have been viable until the 32d or 33d week of pregnancy or even later.51 When Roe was decided, viability was gauged at roughly 28 weeks. See 410  U. S., at 160. Today, respondents draw the line at 23 or 24 weeks. Brief for Respondents 8. So, according to Roe\u2019s logic, States now have a compelling interest in protecting a fetus with a gestational age of, say, 26 weeks, but in 1973 States did not have an interest in protecting an identical fetus. How can that be?\n\u2003Viability also depends on the \u201cquality of the available medical facilities.\u201d Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, 396 (1979). Thus, a 24-week-old fetus may be viable if a woman gives birth in a city with hospitals that provide advanced care for very premature babies, but if the woman travels to a remote area far from any such hospital, the fetus may no longer be viable. On what ground could the constitutional status of a fetus depend on the pregnant woman\u2019s location? And if viability is meant to mark a line having universal moral significance, can it be that a fetus that is viable in a big city in the United States has a privileged moral status not enjoyed by an identical fetus in a remote area of a poor country?\n\u2003In addition, as the Court once explained, viability is not really a hard-and-fast line. Ibid. A physician determining a particular fetus\u2019s odds of surviving outside the womb must consider \u201ca number of variables,\u201d including \u201cgestational age,\u201d \u201cfetal weight,\u201d a woman\u2019s \u201cgeneral health and nutrition,\u201d the \u201cquality of the available medical facilities,\u201d and other factors.

And even if each  fetus\u2019s probability of survival could be ascertained with certainty, settling on a \u201cprobabilit[y] of survival\u201d that should count as \u201cviability\u201d is another matter. Ibid. Is a fetus viable with a 10 percent chance of survival? 25 percent? 50 percent? Can such a judgment be made by a State? And can a State specify a gestational age limit that applies in all cases? Or must these difficult questions be left entirely to the individual \u201cattending physician on the particular facts of the case before him\u201d? Id., at 388.\n\u2003The viability line, which Casey termed Roe\u2019s central rule, makes no sense, and it is telling that other countries almost uniformly eschew such a line.52 The Court thus asserted raw judicial power to impose, as a matter of constitutional law, a uniform viability rule that allowed the States less freedom to regulate abortion than the majority of western democracies enjoy.\nd\n\u2003All in all, Roe\u2019s reasoning was exceedingly weak, and academic commentators, including those who agreed with the decision as a matter of policy, were unsparing in their criticism. John Hart Ely famously wrote that Roe was \u201cnot constitutional law and g[ave] almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.\u201d Ely 947 (emphasis deleted). Archibald Cox, who served as Solicitor General under President Kennedy, commented that Roe \u201cread[s] like a set of hospital rules and regulations\u201d that \u201c[n]either historian, layman, nor lawyer will be persuaded . . . are part of . . . the Constitution.\u201d The Role of the Supreme Court in American Government 113\u2013114 (1976). Laurence Tribe wrote that \u201ceven if there is a need to divide pregnancy into several segments with lines  that clearly identify the limits of governmental power,  \u2018interest-balancing\u2019 of the form the Court pursues fails to justify any of the lines actually drawn.\u201d Tribe 4\u20135. Mark Tushnet termed Roe a \u201ctotally unreasoned judicial opinion.\u201d Red, White, and Blue: A Critical Analysis of Constitutional Law 54 (1988). See also P. Bobbitt, Constitutional Fate 157 (1982); A. Amar, Foreword: The Document and the Doctrine, 114 Harv. L. Rev. 26, 110 (2000).\n\u2003Despite Roe\u2019s weaknesses, its reach was steadily extended in the years that followed. The Court struck down laws requiring that second-trimester abortions be performed only in hospitals, Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 433\u2013439 (1983); that minors obtain parental consent, Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U.

S., at 794 (dissenting opinion). And the United States as amicus curiae asked the Court to overrule Roe five times in the decade before Casey, see 505 U. S., at 844 (joint opinion), and then asked the Court to overrule it once more in Casey itself.\n2\n\u2003When Casey revisited Roe almost 20 years later, very little of Roe\u2019s reasoning was defended or preserved. The Court  abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. 505 U. S., at 846. The Court did not reaffirm Roe\u2019s erroneous account of abortion history. In fact, none of the Justices in the majority said anything about the history of the abortion right. And as for precedent, the Court relied on essentially the same body of cases that Roe had cited. Thus, with respect to the standard grounds for constitutional decisionmaking\u2014text, history, and precedent\u2014Casey did not attempt to bolster Roe\u2019s reasoning.\n\u2003The Court also made no real effort to remedy one of the greatest weaknesses in Roe\u2019s analysis: its much-criticized discussion of viability. The Court retained what it called Roe\u2019s \u201ccentral holding\u201d\u2014that a State may not regulate pre-viability abortions for the purpose of protecting fetal life\u2014but it provided no principled defense of the viability line. 505 U. S., at 860, 870\u2013871. Instead, it merely rephrased what Roe had said, stating that viability marked the point at which \u201cthe independent existence of a second life can in reason and fairness be the object of state protection that now overrides the rights of the woman.\u201d 505 U. S., at 870. Why \u201creason and fairness\u201d demanded that the line be drawn at viability the Court did not explain.

And as we will explain, the test is full of ambiguities and is difficult to apply.\n\u2003Casey, in short, either refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roe\u2019s analysis, failed to remedy glaring  deficiencies in Roe\u2019s reasoning, endorsed what it termed Roe\u2019s central holding while suggesting that a majority might not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the abortion right other than Roe\u2019s status as precedent, and imposed a new and problematic test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent.\n\u2003As discussed below, Casey also deployed a novel version of the doctrine of stare decisis. See infra, at 64\u201369. This new doctrine did not account for the profound wrongness of the decision in Roe, and placed great weight on an intangible form of reliance with little if any basis in prior case law. Stare decisis does not command the preservation of such a decision.\nC\n\u2003Workability. Our precedents counsel that another important consideration in deciding whether a precedent should be overruled is whether the rule it imposes is workable\u2014that is, whether it can be understood and applied in a consistent and predictable manner. Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 792 (2009); Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989); Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S. 271, 283\u2013284 (1988). Casey\u2019s \u201cundue burden\u201d test has scored poorly on the workability scale.\n1\n\u2003Problems begin with the very concept of an \u201cundue burden.\u201d As Justice Scalia noted in his Casey partial dissent, determining whether a burden is \u201cdue\u201d or \u201cundue\u201d is \u201cinherently standardless.\u201d 505 U. S., at 992; see also June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo, 591 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 17) (\u201c[W]hether a burden is deemed undue depends heavily on which factors the judge considers and how much weight he accords each of them\u201d (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)).\n \u2003The Casey plurality tried to put meaning into the \u201cundue burden\u201d test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these rules created their own problems. The first rule is that \u201ca provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\u201d 505 U. S., at 878 (emphasis added); see also id., at 877. But whether a particular obstacle qualifies as \u201csubstantial\u201d is often open to reasonable debate. In the sense relevant here, \u201csubstantial\u201d means \u201cof ample or considerable amount, quantity, or size.\u201d Random House Webster\u2019s Unabridged Dictionary 1897 (2d ed. 2001). Huge burdens are plainly \u201csubstantial,\u201d and trivial ones are not, but in between these extremes, there is a wide gray area.\n\u2003This ambiguity is a problem, and the second rule, which applies at all stages of a pregnancy, muddies things further.

It states that measures designed \u201cto ensure that the woman\u2019s choice is informed\u201d are constitutional so long as they do not impose \u201can undue burden on the right.\u201d Casey, 505 U. S., at 878. To the extent that this rule applies to pre-viability abortions, it overlaps with the first rule and appears to impose a different standard. Consider a law that imposes an insubstantial obstacle but serves little purpose. As applied to a pre-viability abortion, would such a regulation be constitutional on the ground that it does not impose a \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d? Or would it be unconstitutional on the ground that it creates an \u201cundue burden\u201d because the burden it imposes, though slight, outweighs its negligible benefits? Casey does not say, and this ambiguity would lead to confusion down the line. Compare June Medical, 591 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 1\u20132), with id., at ___\u2013___ (Roberts, C. J., concurring) (slip op., at 5\u20136).\n\u2003The third rule complicates the picture even more. Under that rule, \u201c[u]nnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a  woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.\u201d Casey, 505 U. S., at 878 (emphasis added). This rule contains no fewer than three vague terms. It includes the two already discussed\u2014\u201cundue burden\u201d and \u201csubstantial obstacle\u201d\u2014even though they are inconsistent. And it adds a third ambiguous term when it refers to \u201cunnecessary health regulations.\u201d The term \u201cnecessary\u201d has a range of meanings\u2014from \u201cessential\u201d to merely \u201cuseful.\u201d See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 928 (5th ed. 1979); American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 877 (1971). Casey did not explain the sense in which the term is used in this rule.\n\u2003In addition to these problems, one more applies to all three rules. They all call on courts to examine a law\u2019s effect on women, but a regulation may have a very different impact on different women for a variety of reasons, including their places of residence, financial resources, family situations, work and personal obligations, knowledge about fetal development and abortion, psychological and emotional disposition and condition, and the firmness of their desire to obtain abortions. In order to determine whether a regulation presents a substantial obstacle to women, a court needs to know which set of women it should have in mind and how many of the women in this set must find that an obstacle is \u201csubstantial.\u201d\n\u2003Casey provided no clear answer to these questions. It said that a regulation is unconstitutional if it imposes a substantial obstacle \u201cin a large fraction of cases in which [it] is relevant,\u201d 505 U. S., at 895, but there is obviously no clear line between a fraction that is \u201clarge\u201d and one that is not.

Nor is it clear what the Court meant by \u201ccases in which\u201d a regulation is \u201crelevant.\u201d These ambiguities have caused confusion and disagreement. Compare Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. 582, 627\u2013628 (2016), with id., at 666\u2013667, and n. 11 (Alito, J., dissenting).\n 2\n\u2003The difficulty of applying Casey\u2019s new rules surfaced in that very case. The controlling opinion found that Pennsylvania\u2019s 24-hour waiting period requirement and its  informed-consent provision did not impose \u201cundue burden[s],\u201d Casey, 505 U. S., at 881\u2013887, but Justice Stevens, applying the same test, reached the opposite result, id., at 920\u2013922 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). That did not bode well, and then-Chief Justice Rehnquist aptly observed that \u201cthe undue burden standard presents nothing more workable than the trimester framework.\u201d Id., at 964\u2013966 (dissenting opinion).\n\u2003The ambiguity of the \u201cundue burden\u201d test also produced disagreement in later cases. In Whole Woman\u2019s Health, the Court adopted the cost-benefit interpretation of the test, stating that \u201c[t]he rule announced in Casey . . . requires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.\u201d 579 U. S., at 607 (emphasis added). But five years later, a majority of the Justices rejected that interpretation. See June Medical, 591 U. S. ___. Four Justices reaffirmed Whole Woman\u2019s Health\u2019s instruction to \u201cweigh\u201d a law\u2019s \u201cbenefits\u201d against \u201cthe burdens it imposes on abortion access.\u201d 591 U.

S., at ___ (slip op., at 38).\n\u2003Casey has generated a long list of Circuit conflicts. Most recently, the Courts of Appeals have disagreed about whether the balancing test from Whole Woman\u2019s Health correctly states the undue-burden framework.53 They have disagreed on the legality of parental notification rules.54 They have disagreed about bans on certain dilation and evacuation procedures.55 They have disagreed about when an increase in the time needed to reach a clinic constitutes an undue burden.56 And they have disagreed on whether a  State may regulate abortions performed because of the fetus\u2019s race, sex, or disability.57\n\u2003The Courts of Appeals have experienced particular difficulty in applying the large-fraction-of-relevant-cases test. They have criticized the assignment while reaching unpredictable results.58 And they have candidly outlined Casey\u2019s many other problems.59\n\u2003Casey\u2019s \u201cundue burden\u201d test has proved to be unworkable. \u201c[P]lucked from nowhere,\u201d 505 U. S., at 965 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.), it \u201cseems calculated to perpetuate give-it-a-try litigation\u201d before judges assigned an unwieldy and inappropriate task. Lehnert v.

Continued adherence to that standard would undermine, not advance, the \u201cevenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles.\u201d Payne, 501 U.

S., at ___ (opinion of Kavanaugh, J.) (slip op., at 15); Janus, 585 U. S., at ___\u2013___ (slip op., at 34\u201335).\n1\n\u2003Traditional reliance interests arise \u201cwhere advance planning of great precision is most obviously a necessity.\u201d Casey, 505 U. S., at 856 (joint opinion); see also Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. In Casey, the controlling opinion conceded that those traditional reliance interests were not implicated because getting an abortion is generally \u201cunplanned activity,\u201d and \u201creproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions.\u201d 505 U. S., at 856. For these reasons, we agree with the Casey plurality that conventional, concrete reliance interests are not present here.\n 2\n\u2003Unable to find reliance in the conventional sense, the controlling opinion in Casey perceived a more intangible form of reliance. It wrote that \u201cpeople [had] organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society . . . in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail\u201d and that \u201c[t]he ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives.\u201d Ibid. But this Court is ill-equipped to assess \u201cgeneralized assertions about the national psyche.\u201d Id., at 957 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.). Casey\u2019s notion of reliance thus finds little support in our cases, which instead emphasize very concrete reliance interests, like those that develop in \u201ccases involving property and contract rights.\u201d Payne, 501 U. S., at 828.\n\u2003When a concrete reliance interest is asserted, courts are equipped to evaluate the claim, but assessing the novel and intangible form of reliance endorsed by the Casey plurality is another matter.

The contending sides also make conflicting arguments about the status of the fetus. This Court has neither the authority nor the expertise to adjudicate those disputes, and the Casey plurality\u2019s speculations and weighing of the relative importance of the fetus and mother represent a departure from the \u201coriginal constitutional proposition\u201d that \u201ccourts  do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.\u201d Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 729\u2013730 (1963).\n\u2003 Our decision returns the issue of abortion to those legislative bodies, and it allows women on both sides of the abortion issue to seek to affect the legislative process by influencing public opinion, lobbying legislators, voting, and running for office. Women are not without electoral or political power. It is noteworthy that the percentage of women who register to vote and cast ballots is consistently higher than the percentage of men who do so.66 In the last election in November 2020, women, who make up around 51.5 percent of the population of Mississippi,67 constituted 55.5 percent of the voters who cast ballots.68\n3\n\u2003Unable to show concrete reliance on Roe and Casey themselves, the Solicitor General suggests that overruling those decisions would \u201cthreaten the Court\u2019s precedents holding that the Due Process Clause protects other rights.\u201d Brief for United States 26 (citing Obergefell, 576 U. S. 644; Lawrence, 539 U. S. 558; Griswold, 381 U. S. 479). That is not correct for reasons we have already discussed. As even the Casey plurality recognized, \u201c[a]bortion is a unique act\u201d because it terminates \u201clife or potential life.\u201d 505 U. S., at 852; see also Roe, 410 U.

And to ensure that our decision is not misunderstood or mischaracterized, we emphasize that our decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\nIV\n\u2003Having shown that traditional stare decisis factors do not weigh in favor of retaining Roe or Casey, we must address one final argument that featured prominently in the Casey plurality opinion.\n\u2003The argument was cast in different terms, but stated simply, it was essentially as follows.

The American people\u2019s belief in the rule of law would be shaken if they lost respect for this Court as an institution that decides important cases based on principle, not \u201csocial and political pressures.\u201d 505 U. S., at 865. There is a special danger that the public will perceive a decision as having been made for unprincipled reasons when the Court overrules a controversial \u201cwatershed\u201d decision, such as Roe. 505 U. S., at 866\u2013867. A decision overruling Roe would be perceived as having been made \u201cunder fire\u201d and as a \u201csurrender to political pressure,\u201d 505 U. S., at 867, and therefore the preservation of public approval of the Court weighs heavily in favor of retaining Roe, see 505 U. S., at 869.\n\u2003This analysis starts out on the right foot but ultimately veers off course. The Casey plurality was certainly right that it is important for the public to perceive that our decisions are based on principle, and we should make every effort to achieve that objective by issuing opinions that carefully show how a proper understanding of the law leads to the results we reach. But we cannot exceed the scope of our authority under the Constitution, and we cannot allow our decisions to be affected by any extraneous influences such as concern about the public\u2019s reaction to our work. Cf. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397 (1989); Brown, 347 U. S. 483. That is true both when we initially decide a constitutional issue and when we consider whether to overrule a prior decision. As Chief Justice Rehnquist explained, \u201cThe Judicial Branch derives its legitimacy, not from following public opinion, but from deciding by its best lights whether legislative enactments of the popular branches of Government comport with the Constitution. The doctrine of stare decisis is an adjunct of this duty, and should be no more subject to the vagaries of public opinion than is the basic judicial task.\u201d Casey, 505 U. S., at 963 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). In suggesting otherwise, the Casey plurality went beyond this Court\u2019s role in our constitutional system.\n\u2003The Casey plurality \u201ccall[ed] the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division,\u201d and claimed the authority to impose a permanent settlement of the issue of a constitutional abortion right simply by saying that the matter was closed. Id., at 867. That unprecedented claim exceeded the power vested in us by the Constitution. As Alexander Hamilton famously put it, the Constitution gives the judiciary \u201cneither Force nor Will.\u201d The Federalist No. 78, p. 523 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).

The Court has no authority to decree that an erroneous precedent is permanently exempt from evaluation under traditional stare decisis principles. A precedent of this Court is subject to the usual principles of stare decisis under which adherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command. If the rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy and Lochner would still be the law. That is not how stare decisis operates.\n\u2003The Casey plurality also misjudged the practical limits of  this Court\u2019s influence. Roe certainly did not succeed in ending division on the issue of abortion. On the contrary, Roe \u201cinflamed\u201d a national issue that has remained bitterly divisive for the past half century. Casey, 505 U. S., at 995 (opinion of Scalia, J.); see also R. Ginsburg, Speaking in a Judicial Voice, 67 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1185, 1208 (1992) (Roe may have \u201chalted a political process,\u201d \u201cprolonged divisiveness,\u201d and \u201cdeferred stable settlement of the issue\u201d). And for the past 30 years, Casey has done the same.\n\u2003 Neither decision has ended debate over the issue of a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Indeed, in this case, 26 States expressly ask us to overrule Roe and Casey and to return the issue of abortion to the people and their elected representatives. This Court\u2019s inability to end debate on the issue should not have been surprising. This Court cannot bring about the permanent resolution of a rancorous national controversy simply by dictating a settlement and telling the people to move on. Whatever influence the Court may have on public attitudes must stem from the strength of our opinions, not an attempt to exercise \u201craw judicial power.\u201d Roe, 410 U. S., at 222 (White, J., dissenting).\n\u2003We do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to today\u2019s decision overruling Roe and Casey. And even if we could foresee what will happen, we would have no authority to let that knowledge influence our decision. We can only do our job, which is to interpret the law, apply longstanding principles of stare decisis, and decide this case accordingly.\n\u2003We therefore hold that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. Roe and Casey must be overruled, and the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives.\n V\nA\n1\n\u2003The dissent argues that we have \u201cabandon[ed]\u201d stare decisis, post, at 30, but we have done no such thing, and it is the dissent\u2019s understanding of stare decisis that breaks with tradition. The dissent\u2019s foundational contention is that the Court should never (or perhaps almost never) overrule an egregiously wrong constitutional precedent unless the Court can \u201cpoin[t] to major legal or factual changes undermining [the] decision\u2019s original basis.\u201d Post, at 37. To support this contention, the dissent claims that Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, and other landmark cases overruling prior precedents \u201cresponded to changed law and to changed facts and attitudes that had taken hold throughout society.\u201d Post, at 43.

The unmistakable implication of this argument is that only the passage of time and new developments justified those decisions. Recognition that the cases they overruled were egregiously wrong on the day they were handed down was not enough.\n\u2003The Court has never adopted this strange new version of stare decisis\u2014and with good reason. Does the dissent really maintain that overruling Plessy was not justified until the country had experienced more than a half-century of state-sanctioned segregation and generations of Black school children had suffered all its effects? Post, at 44\u201345.\n\u2003Here is another example. On the dissent\u2019s view, it must have been wrong for West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, to overrule Minersville School Dist. v. Gobitis, 310 U. S. 586, a bare three years after it was handed down. In both cases, children who were Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses refused on religious grounds to salute the flag or recite the pledge of allegiance. The Barnette Court did not claim that its reexamination of the issue was prompted by any intervening legal or factual developments, so if the  Court had followed the dissent\u2019s new version of stare decisis, it would have been compelled to adhere to Gobitis and countenance continued First Amendment violations for some unspecified period.\n\u2003Precedents should be respected, but sometimes the Court errs, and occasionally the Court issues an important decision that is egregiously wrong. When that happens, stare decisis is not a straitjacket. And indeed, the dissent eventually admits that a decision could \u201cbe overruled just because it is terribly wrong,\u201d though the dissent does not explain when that would be so. Post, at 45.\n2\n\u2003Even if the dissent were correct in arguing that an egregiously wrong decision should (almost) never be overruled unless its mistake is later highlighted by \u201cmajor legal or factual changes,\u201d reexamination of Roe and Casey would be amply justified. We have already mentioned a number of post-Casey developments, see supra, at 33\u201334, 59\u201363, but the most profound change may be the failure of the Casey plurality\u2019s call for \u201cthe contending sides\u201d in the controversy about abortion \u201cto end their national division,\u201d 505 U. S., at 867. That has not happened, and there is no reason to think that another decision sticking with Roe would achieve what Casey could not.\n\u2003The dissent, however, is undeterred. It contends that the \u201cvery controversy surrounding Roe and Casey\u201d is an important stare decisis consideration that requires upholding those precedents. See post, at 55\u201357. The dissent characterizes Casey as a \u201cprecedent about precedent\u201d that is permanently shielded from further evaluation under traditional stare decisis principles. See post, at 57. But as we have explained, Casey broke new ground when it treated the national controversy provoked by Roe as a ground for refusing to reconsider that decision, and no subsequent case has relied on that factor.

But as we have explained, Casey broke new ground when it treated the national controversy provoked by Roe as a ground for refusing to reconsider that decision, and no subsequent case has relied on that factor. Our decision today simply applies  longstanding stare decisis factors instead of applying a version of the doctrine that seems to apply only in abortion cases.\n3\n\u2003Finally, the dissent suggests that our decision calls into question Griswold, Eisenstadt, Lawrence, and Obergefell. Post, at 4\u20135, 26\u201327, n. 8. But we have stated unequivocally that \u201c[n]othing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.\u201d Supra, at 66. We have also explained why that is so: rights regarding contraception and same-sex relationships are inherently different from the right to abortion because the latter (as we have stressed) uniquely involves what Roe and Casey termed \u201cpotential life.\u201d Roe, 410 U. S., at 150 (emphasis deleted); Casey, 505 U. S., at 852. Therefore, a right to abortion cannot be justified by a purported analogy to the rights recognized in those other cases or by \u201cappeals to a broader right to autonomy.\u201d Supra, at 32. It is hard to see how we could be clearer. Moreover, even putting aside that these cases are distinguishable, there is a further point that the dissent ignores: Each precedent is subject to its own stare decisis analysis, and the factors that our doctrine instructs us to consider like reliance and workability are different for these cases than for our abortion jurisprudence.\nB\n1\n\u2003We now turn to the concurrence in the judgment, which reproves us for deciding whether Roe and Casey should be retained or overruled. That opinion (which for convenience we will call simply \u201cthe concurrence\u201d) recommends a \u201cmore measured course,\u201d which it defends based on what it claims is \u201ca straightforward stare decisis analysis.\u201d Post, at 1 (opinion of Roberts, C. J.). The concurrence would \u201cleave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion  at all,\u201d post, at 7, and would hold only that if the Constitution protects any such right, the right ends once women have had \u201ca reasonable opportunity\u201d to obtain an abortion, post, at 1. The concurrence does not specify what period of time is sufficient to provide such an opportunity, but it would hold that 15 weeks, the period allowed under Mississippi\u2019s law, is enough\u2014at least \u201cabsent rare circumstances.\u201d Post, at 2, 10.\n\u2003There are serious problems with this approach, and it is revealing that nothing like it was recommended by either party. As we have recounted, both parties and the Solicitor General have urged us either to reaffirm or overrule Roe and Casey. See supra, at 4\u20135. And when the specific approach advanced by the concurrence was broached at oral argument, both respondents and the Solicitor General emphatically rejected it.

The Solicitor General argued that abandoning the viability line would leave courts and others with \u201cno continued guidance.\u201d Id., at 101. What is more, the concurrence has not identified any of the more than 130 amicus briefs filed in this case that advocated its approach. The concurrence would do exactly what it criticizes Roe for doing: pulling \u201cout of thin air\u201d a test that \u201c[n]o party or amicus asked the Court to adopt.\u201d Post, at 3.\n2\n\u2003The concurrence\u2019s most fundamental defect is its failure to offer any principled basis for its approach. The concurrence would \u201cdiscar[d]\u201d \u201cthe rule from Roe and Casey that a woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is regarded as \u2018viable\u2019 outside the womb.\u201d Post, at 2. But this rule was a critical component of the holdings in Roe and Casey, and stare decisis is \u201ca doctrine of preservation, not transformation,\u201d Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm\u2019n, 558 U. S. 310, 384 (2010)  (Roberts, C. J., concurring). Therefore, a new rule that discards the viability rule cannot be defended on stare decisis grounds.\n\u2003The concurrence concedes that its approach would \u201cnot be available\u201d if \u201cthe rationale of Roe and Casey were inextricably entangled with and dependent upon the viability standard.\u201d Post, at 7. But the concurrence asserts that the viability line is separable from the constitutional right they recognized, and can therefore be \u201cdiscarded\u201d without disturbing any past precedent. Post, at 7\u20138. That is simply incorrect.\n\u2003Roe\u2019s trimester rule was expressly tied to viability, see 410 U. S., at 163\u2013164, and viability played a critical role in later abortion decisions. For example, in Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, the Court reiterated Roe\u2019s rule that a \u201cState may regulate an abortion to protect the life of the fetus and even may proscribe abortion\u201d at \u201cthe stage subsequent to viability.\u201d 428 U. S., at 61 (emphasis added). The Court then rejected a challenge to Missouri\u2019s definition of viability, holding that the State\u2019s definition was consistent with Roe\u2019s. 428 U. S., at 63\u201364. If viability was not an essential part of the rule adopted in Roe, the Court would have had no need to make that comparison.\n\u2003The holding in Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, is even more instructive. In that case, the Court noted that prior cases had \u201cstressed viability\u201d and reiterated that \u201c[v]iability is the critical point\u201d under Roe. 439 U. S., at 388\u2013389.

It is a rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce\u201d (emphasis added)); id., at 872 (A \u201cwoman has a right to choose to terminate or continue her pregnancy before viability\u201d (emphasis added)); id., at 879 (\u201c[A] State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\u2003Our subsequent cases have continued to recognize the centrality of the viability rule. See Whole Women\u2019s Health, 579 U. S., at 589\u2013590 (\u201c[A] provision of law is constitutionally invalid, if the \u2018purpose or effect\u2019 of the provision \u2018is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability\u2019 \u201d (emphasis deleted and added)); id., at 627 (\u201c[W]e now use \u2018viability\u2019 as the relevant point at which a State may begin limiting women\u2019s access to abortion for reasons unrelated to maternal health\u201d (emphasis added)).\n\u2003Not only is the new rule proposed by the concurrence inconsistent with Casey\u2019s unambiguous \u201clanguage,\u201d post, at 8, it is also contrary to the judgment in that case and later abortion cases. In Casey, the Court held that Pennsylvania\u2019s spousal-notification provision was facially unconstitutional, not just that it was unconstitutional as applied to abortions sought prior to the time when a woman has had a reasonable opportunity to choose. See 505 U. S., at 887\u2013898. The same is true of Whole Women\u2019s Health, which held that certain rules that required physicians performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital were facially unconstitutional because they placed \u201ca substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previability abortion.\u201d 579 U. S., at 591 (emphasis added).\n\u2003For all these reasons, stare decisis cannot justify the new  \u201creasonable opportunity\u201d rule propounded by the concurrence. If that rule is to become the law of the land, it must stand on its own, but the concurrence makes no attempt to show that this rule represents a correct interpretation of the Constitution. The concurrence does not claim that the right to a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion is \u201c \u2018deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u2019 \u201d Glucksberg, 521 U.

S., at 720\u2013721. Nor does it propound any other theory that could show that the Constitution supports its new rule. And if the Constitution protects a woman\u2019s right to obtain an abortion, the opinion does not explain why that right should end after the point at which all \u201creasonable\u201d women will have decided whether to seek an abortion. While the concurrence is moved by a desire for judicial minimalism, \u201cwe cannot embrace a narrow ground of decision simply because it is narrow; it must also be right.\u201d Citizens United, 558 U. S., at 375 (Roberts, C. J., concurring). For the reasons that we have explained, the concurrence\u2019s approach is not.\n3\n\u2003The concurrence would \u201cleave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion at all,\u201d post, at 7, but \u201canother day\u201d would not be long in coming. Some States have set deadlines for obtaining an abortion that are shorter than Mississippi\u2019s. See, e.g., Memphis Center for Reproductive Health v. Slatery, 14 F. 4th, at 414 (considering law with bans \u201cat cascading intervals of two to three weeks\u201d beginning at six weeks), reh\u2019g en banc granted, 14 F. 4th 550 (CA6 2021). If we held only that Mississippi\u2019s 15-week rule is constitutional, we would soon be called upon to pass on the constitutionality of a panoply of laws with shorter deadlines or no deadline at all. The \u201cmeasured course\u201d charted by the concurrence would be fraught with turmoil until the Court answered the question that the concurrence seeks to  defer.\n\u2003Even if the Court ultimately adopted the new rule suggested by the concurrence, we would be faced with the difficult problem of spelling out what it means. For example, if the period required to give women a \u201creasonable\u201d opportunity to obtain an abortion were pegged, as the concurrence seems to suggest, at the point when a certain percentage of women make that choice, see post, at 1\u20132, 9\u201310, we would have to identify the relevant percentage. It would also be necessary to explain what the concurrence means when it refers to \u201crare circumstances\u201d that might justify an exception. Post, at 10. And if this new right aims to give women a reasonable opportunity to get an abortion, it would be necessary to decide whether factors other than promptness in deciding might have a bearing on whether such an opportunity was available.\n\u2003In sum, the concurrence\u2019s quest for a middle way would only put off the day when we would be forced to confront the question we now decide. The turmoil wrought by Roe and Casey would be prolonged. It is far better\u2014for this Court and the country\u2014to face up to the real issue without further delay.\nVI\n\u2003We must now decide what standard will govern if state abortion regulations undergo constitutional challenge and whether the law before us satisfies the appropriate standard.\nA\n\u2003Under our precedents, rational-basis review is the appropriate standard for such challenges.

As we have explained, procuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional right because such a right has no basis in the Constitution\u2019s text or in our Nation\u2019s history. See supra, at 8\u201339.\n \u2003It follows that the States may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are challenged under the Constitution, courts cannot \u201csubstitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.\u201d Ferguson, 372 U. S., at 729\u2013730; see also Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U. S. 471, 484\u2013486 (1970); United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152 (1938). That respect for a legislature\u2019s judgment applies even when the laws at issue concern matters of great social significance and moral substance. See, e.g., Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356, 365\u2013368 (2001) (\u201ctreatment of the disabled\u201d); Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 728 (\u201cassisted suicide\u201d); San Antonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 32\u201335, 55 (1973) (\u201cfinancing public education\u201d).\n\u2003A law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is entitled to a \u201cstrong presumption of validity.\u201d Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319 (1993). It must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests. Id., at 320; FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U. S. 307, 313 (1993); New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U. S. 297, 303 (1976) (per curiam); Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 491 (1955). These legitimate interests include respect for and preservation of prenatal life at all stages of development, Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 157\u2013158; the protection of maternal health and safety; the elimination of particularly gruesome or barbaric medical procedures; the preservation of the integrity of the medical profession; the mitigation of fetal pain; and the prevention of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or disability. See id., at 156\u2013157; Roe, 410 U. S., at 150; cf. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 728\u2013731 (identifying similar interests).\n B\n\u2003These legitimate interests justify Mississippi\u2019s Gestational Age Act.

Abortion presents a profound moral question. The Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. Roe and Casey arrogated that authority. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives.\n\u2003The judgment of the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\n", "doc_id": "40059e42-f09a-45ae-9dbc-72e916fe06c4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3ded0794f18b0a19d2d487f0ab1df45604c88e60b767ed3db25742623f3faa45", "extra_info": {"document_id": "1OYyXhZ3vZt9_hN-_PLRYwAEaghAchk7S-vdoY4B_jVs"}, "node_info": {"start": 155139, "end": 156681}, "relationships": {"1": "61de6981-d5d9-46cd-b938-eadee7a82e6b", "2": "4294227c-2380-4cc4-a79f-b03307ec99ae"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
